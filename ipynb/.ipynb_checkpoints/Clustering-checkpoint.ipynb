      "A key assumption in my research is that we can reasonably draw inferences based upon a county's movement relative to the group of which it is a member.  In order to avoid any a priori assumptions about which counties belong to which group, we are attempting to key on particular attributes, thereby allowing membership to be an emergent property of the process.  In other words, instead of picking counties, we choose the attribute (e.g. economic output) and group counties together with similar values of said attribute.  \n",

      "Such classification is often done by binning groups based upon quantile or fixed boundaries.  While this is a useful technique, it has at least one substantial drawback:\n",
      "\n",
      "*Whether it's based upon membership size (quantile) or threshold identification (fixed boundaries), the approach introduces somewhat rigid constraints that can have the effect of grouping dissimilar things.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Clustering algorithms (e.g. [k-means](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)) partially offset this difficulty because they are optimization routines that seek to maximize similarity within group while maximizing dissimilarity across groups.  Even still, the selection of the number of groups is an input parameter and may thus still introduce a level of arbitrariness.  Nevertheless, when viewed in this way, binning is basically a special case of clustering characterized by a rigid input structure.  Clustering has one structural input, the number of groups.  Binning has two structural inputs, the number of groups *and* the spacing of boundaries (quantile)/the location of boundaries (fixed boundary).  The practical effect is the potential for group-specific outliers to mischaracterize the true dynamics of the group.\n",
