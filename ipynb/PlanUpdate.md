#Revision of Dissertation Plan

The time has come to revise the scope of my inquiry.  My expectations were quite high with my initial proposal draft, so my [refined plan](https://github.com/choct155/TELs/blob/master/auxprod/RefinedPlan_28FEB2013update.docx) sought to limit the scope of inquiry by focusing on hypotheses that drew from a common dataset.  Having worked through some of the analysis has revealed, however, that even this "streamlined" version was still a bit ambitious.  It featured three empricial sections, which is not unreasonable.  However, the sections housed  14 hypotheses among them.  The amount of analysis required apparently outstrips what is needed to demonstrate doctoral level proficiency, so what follows is a distillation of this plan.

##Analysis To Date

At the current time, I have done much of the work required to demonstrate the impact of TELs on both the clustering of economic and fiscal behavior and the divergence between the expenditure profiles desired by jurisdictions and the actual expenditure composition they use.  The final models need to be adjusted for both, but this will be revisited when all the pieces are completed to understand the best means of fitting them together.

##Value Added

There is a wealth of rich research in the area of tax and expenditure limitations, but my research has three components that are not currently (or barely are) in play:

1. Most research attacks TELs from the perspective of evaluating the average effect across jurisdictions.  [Mullins' work](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0275-1100.2004.00350.x/abstract;jsessionid=6EF2FF4ACCC437DBE4BAACA6016F3945.f02t03?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false) is a notable exception in this regard, and it seems only fitting that I extend the body of work in this area.

2. Variability in the application of TELs has been difficult to capture.  The simple reason is, in a nutshell, that authorizing statutes and/or constitutional provisions do not change all that rapidly.  The most common approach for introducing variation has been the construction of indices from TEL provisions.  This has led to even more focus on state comparisons than might otherwise be the case (because variation in TEL structure is typically across states).  Furthermore, researchers have had difficulty studying the effect of overlapping policies, which typically disrupt the impact that indices are trying to pick up.  My approach has been to abstract away from specific provisions, towards the impact of said provisions on individual jurisdictions.  The measure (intensity stock) seeks to capture the cumulative constraint placed upon revenue sources for each jurisdiction.  It varies as a function of economic base growth.  To the best of my knowledge, this is a unique approach.

3. When averaging the effect of TELs across all local governments in a state, one is less concerned with the externalities across said jurisdictions.  However, when evaluating the responses of individual local governments (as I seek to do here), spatial considerations are non-trivial.  A growing amount of research across the public policy/economic spectrum is explicitly incorporating spatial dependency into estimation strategies, and my research is a part of this trend.  The difference is that TEL research is a new application on this front.

##Distillation

Dr. Mullins and I had a meeting today (1/9/2014) in which we discussed (among other things) the need to focus on one or two hypotheses per emprical section.  To my mind, the consensus view after this meeting reflected three things:

1. The components of the above value-added discussion;
2. Leveraging the analysis I have done to date; and,
3. Continuity of inquiry.

The long run model is understanding the impact of TELs on economic growth.  To get there we will first ask whether or not TELs cause divergences between actual and desired expenditure profiles.  The implication is that the jurisdiction will have a more difficult time attracting residents and employers when expenditure choices are artificially constrained.  The next step is evaluating whether or not there is a TEL related impact on fiscal capacity.  If so, the impact of the TEL is dynamic in the sense that it creates a downward fiscal spiral.  Finally, we ask if there is an impact on economic dynamics, which we may link back to the results of the existence of systemic fiscal constraints.

The hypotheses for this approach are as follows:

*Expenditure Choices*
H1:  TELs create wedges between preferred and actual expenditure portfolios
H2:  TELs decrease variation in expenditure portfolios across local governments that are similarly constrained by said TELs and increase variation between more affluent (less constrained) and less affluent (more constrained) jurisdictions
H3:  TELs will reduce the propensity for capital investment

*Fiscal Capacity*
H4:  TELs increase differentials in fiscal capacity across jurisdictions
H5:  TELs increase spatial clustering of revenue outcomes
H6:  TELs increase spatial clustering of fiscal capacity

*Economic Impact*
H7:  TELs decrease the attractiveness of a jurisdiction for residents
H8:  TELs decrease the attractiveness of a jurisdiction for employers
