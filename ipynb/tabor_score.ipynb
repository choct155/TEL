      "The key innovation in my research strategy is to explore the impact of tax and expenditure limitations on the spatial linkages between local governments.  This requires variation in the impact of tax and expenditure limitations to separate this work from the TEL studies that have come before it.  While there have been some preliminary attempts at an index (see XX) for TELs, I have yet to see one that attempts to capture county level variation in impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "[TABOR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxpayer_Bill_of_Rights) provides an opportunity to model such variation because of the capacity for 'deBrucing'.  deBrucing is the process by which a local government votes on whether or not it's tax base should be subject to the constraints of TABOR.  This provides cross-sectional variation that we can exploit.  Temporal variation arises when individual counties address portions of the tax base over time, or when state-level changes are enacted.  The combination of these two sources of variation provides a ready basis for panel estimation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This script will be used to flesh out the scoring mechanism that attempts to capture the variation of TABOR 'intensity' felt by each county over time.  The manner in which counties address these issues is varied and complicated, so some simplification will be required to develop a standard score.  We will do our best to capture as much variation as possible.\n",

      "My inital thought was to build the dataset in Excel, but then this struck me as silly.  Why give up the annotation capacity of a Notebook when entering data into ndarrays is just as easy as entering data into cells (in theory)?  Consequently, the entire build will take place in this script, enabling explicit documentation of the judgement call made."

If revenue does not grow enough in a given year to come into contact with the TABOR limit, the base used to determine the following year's limit is reduced (a.k.a. ratched down).  **This practice, coupled with the absense of cost structure consideration, has the dynamic effect of instituting a lower revenue baseline quite independent of expenditure need.**  This is particularly problematic during recessions.\n",

Furthermore, in FY2002-03, over 70% of property value was located in 10 counties (Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, El Paso, Jefferson, Larimer, and Weld).

This would permanently reset the property tax baseline independent of expenditure need, and create fiscal stress.

      "In attempting to capture this activity, we are faced with an inevitable consequence of dealing with independently derived legislation.  Each county drafts legislation that presumably fits their needs.  In some cases, the broad exemption of revenues from TABOR occurs in piecemeal fashion.  For example, in 1996, Gunnison County passed legislation that exempted only excess revenues from \"grants, fees, interest, sales tax, and all other revenue sources.\"  While this does sound all encompassing, apparently it did not cover property taxes.  These were, in fact, exempted in subsequent legislation in 2000.  \n",

There is also a pre-TABOR general limit on property taxes of 5.5% from the previous year.  If revenues are exempt from TABOR, but not exempt from the general limit, a given county will retain less flexibility over revenue than will any county not subject to said limit.  It is, therefore, important information that we must also capture.\n",

In the value array the first position corresponds to the date of the exemption, and the second corresponds to whether or not the 5.5% growth limit was also waived ([0|1] indicates [no|yes]).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:** Archuleta County is an unusual case because they came in and out of exemptions over time.  It appears they began in 1994 with a spending limit waiver, and subsequent legislation kept some form of a waiver in place for all years except the 1997-2001 period.  At this time, it appears to be the most reasonable starting point, but it should be noted that the 5.5% waiver did not come until later.  This may need to be revisited later."

Unfortunately, these data are in PDF, and thus must be entered manually.  All of this work has been done in *asmt_add*.  The dataset is called co_asmt_93_05.csv.
