\begin_layout AbstractN
This analysis evaluates three tax and expenditure limitation (TEL) policies
 in Colorado: the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights (TABOR), the Statewide Limitation
 on Property Tax Revenue (SLPTR), and the Gallagher Amendment (GA).
 It extends previous research in two novel ways.
 First, it enables analysis of overlapping policies while incorporating
 county-specific characteristics by abstracting away from specific policies.
 Rather, the focus rests on the impacts of these policies on property tax
 levies.
 Second, it incorporates spatial dependency to account for overlapping populatio
ns and economic activity.
 Within this framework, the revenue and expenditure implications of TEL
 policies are evaluated, and TELs are found to have material impacts in
 both cases.
 TELs are associated with depressed revenues and measurable changes in expenditu
re behavior.
 With this context, the final empirical section evaluates the drivers of
 successful

 efforts, in which localities are able to exempt themselves from components
 of TABOR and SLPTR.
 The analysis demonstrates that socioeconomic factors are the dominant determina
nt of voting outcomes.

\begin_layout Acknowledgements
My journey through the doctoral process, to which my wife can attest, has
 been a lengthy enterprise.
 The length of this process is, in large part, a consequence of having held
 multiple jobs during this time.
 Indeed, my time with American University, DC's Office of Revenue Analysis,
 and the Congressional Budget Office have all made their imprint on this
 work.
 However, what such an approach has cost me in terms of duration has been,
 in my estimation, more than offset by the quality of the folks that have
 touched my life along the way.
 In truth, this work is a reflection of not only my personal knowledge and
 growth, but also of the experiences I have collected by way of my interactions
 with family, friends, colleagues, professional superiors, and colleages.
 I cannot practically identify them all here, but I can accomodate the highlight
s.
 I will break with tradition and first mention the single most important
 person, my wife.
 Without her patience and understanding, or lack thereof in some situations,
 I would never have made it through to the end.
 Both poles proved essential, for the world is not made of gumdrops and
 unicorns.
 Her perserverence is a testament to her character, and a reminder of why
 I am a lucky man.
 My parents, in addition to their unassailable support, have provided the
 incredibly durable gift of making good decisions on behalf of my brother
 and me.
 They put us first, and in so doing, provided me with the necessary tools
 to undertake this task.
 My brother, though it took me a long time to realize it, gave me an enduring
 reason to stay curious and focused on trying to leave the world more informed
 than I found it.
 He once called me his teacher, which blew me away.
 Sometimes I wonder if he knows how much he has taught me.
 Of course, I am quite grateful to my committee, consisting of Rene Aubourg,
 Jocelyn Johnston, John Mikesell, and Dan Mullins.
 Each of them assisted me through the uncharted waters of this dissertation.
 Dan Mullins, my chair, has been of particular importance.
 He has been my technical guide since long before the dissertation germinated
 into something tractable.
 But, more than that, beyond the equations and concepts, he has imparted
 knowledge about what it means to be a scholar.
 It is not a task, it is a mindset and lifestyle.
 Most importantly, this is just the beginning.
