 Tax Limitations - Voting, Colorado Ballot #1, 1992
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1992, by a vote of 812,308 to 700,906, Colorado voters chose to amend
 Section 20 of Article X of the Colorado State Constitution.
 The initiative is known as the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR), one of
 the most well-known tax and expenditure limitations (TELs) in the United
 States.
 A remarkable 43.3% of the total population

\begin_layout Subsection
What is the Purpose of this Inquiry?
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:ResearchObjectives"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this study writ large is to explore the endogenous role of
 fiscal institutions in emergent fiscal outcomes.
 The class of institutions studied here, tax and expenditure limitations,
 act directly on fiscal outcomes by restricting the set of feasible choices
 for revenue generation and the allocation of public funds.
 These institutions, however, are generally enacted as a response to dissatisfac
tion with realized fiscal outcomes.
 It would be reasonable to push this point further: the magnitude of the
 restriction bears some relationship to the extent of the dissatisfaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such endogeneity is notoriously difficult to untangle, even when the scope
 of the phenomenon under study is restricted.
 In the case of tax and expenditure limitations, there are many moving parts.
 TELs typically have broad application, affecting jurisdictions with wide
 variation in socioeconomic circumstance and constituent preference.
 Each of these jurisdictions differs in its revenue portfolio, as well as
 the complexity and scope of its expenditure responsibilities.
 Furthermore, each of these subsystems is vulnerable to the whims of macro-level
 fluctuations in economic activity and legal structure.
 Analytic tractability requires a reduction in the data space, so that we
 may tie together a plausible model of the world.
 This reduction is necessary in any rigorous analysis, but endogeneity is
 not making the task any easier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason, we identify three broad objectives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Evaluate the impact of TELs on revenue yield and capacity;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Evaluate the extent to which TELs impact expenditure choices; and,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Explore whether or not TELs help to align voter preferences with fiscal
 outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, it would be reasonable to classify this analysis as firmly in
 the political economic arena.
 As will be discussed, TELs are blunt instruments.
 Their popularity, given this lack of surgical precision, is curious to
 say the least.
 This study aims to shed light on why these policies are enacted.
 The upfront material and even the first two empirical sections (revenue
 and expenditure impacts, respectively) may be viewed as context for this
 motivating inquiry.
 The approach taken seeks to understand the drivers of votes that exempt
 counties from the strictures of TABOR, but these drivers cannot be comprehended
 without understanding the impacts of TELs on local public finance 
\emph on
and how those impacts vary across counties with differing socioeconomic
 circumstances.

\emph default
 The fiscal circumstances of a given county contain information not only
 about the material resources available to that county, but also information
 about the preferences of county voters.
 These two informational inputs are difficult to separate from each other
 and voter outcomes.
 What follows does not speak to the separation of resources and preference,
 but it does attempt to address the endogeneity issue by using a predictive
 framework that incorporates the county-specific stress faced by the counties
 in the sample.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is the Value Added?
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:ValueAdd"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This kind of analysis is not novel in a broad sense.
 As we will see, there exists a formidable literature on TELs.
 There are two major elements that differentiate this study from those that
 have preceded it.
 First, rather than focus on a single policy (e.g.
 TABOR), this analysis models the joint impact of overlapping policies.
 The most novel element of this approach is abstraction away from the explicit
 program elements.
 Previous studies have often modeled the existence of TELs with binary indicator
s, or built an index score based upon factors like method of passage (statutory
 vs.
 constitutional), ease of override, and the magnitude of the growth ceiling
 among other things.
 Unless we believe that the impacts of TELs are additive, binary approaches
 lack the informational resolution to model the joint impacts of overlapping
 policies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Index methods, on the other hand, have a commensurability problem.
 Just because one TEL has a statutory authorization and another has a constituti
onal authorization, is the former fundamentally less restrictive than the
 latter in all cases? Even if we roll all elements of the index into the
 equation, does an override procedure have universal impact irrespective
 of the joint distribution of remaining TEL components? Both the binary
 and index approaches also suffer from lack of variation in the impact across
 jurisdictions.
 The restrictiveness of TELs, as we will see, is quite dependent upon the
 circumstances of the constrained jurisdiction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For all of these reasons, this study attacks the issue from a novel perspective.
 To operationalize these policies,
\emph on
 the focus is shifted from program design to program impact
\emph default
.
 Instead of asking how a TEL was passed, for example, we ask what is the
 feasible levy given the existence of the policy? This approach rests on
 a constraint function that carries arguments for revenue impact and jurisdictio
n-specific characteristics.
 In so doing, it avoids implicit assumptions about commensurability, facilitates
 modeling of joint impact for multiple policies, and provides continuous
 variation across jurisdictions.
 Ultimately, the aforementioned deficiencies are hard to overcome, and indeed,
 this study makes an imperfect attempt.
 We will still have to make some assumptions that are less than desirable.
 However, the philosophy followed here suggests that more is knowable about
 the impact of TELs on specific jurisdictions, and we should use that informatio
n to the extent possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second major innovation in the world of TEL research is the explicit
 acknowledgement of spatial dependency.
 No jurisdiction operates in a vacuum.
 By virtue of the fact that this study evaluates the impact of state-enacted
 policies on local governments, the very design suggests that vertical relations
hips across governmental entities matter.
 Horizontal relationships are also important components of the system.
 As it turns out, externalities are real.
 The impact of one jurisdiction influences, and is influenced by, the actions
 of jurisdictions in the local neighborhood.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The local neighborhood represents jurisdictions that are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the jurisdiction in question.
 What it means to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 varies by analytic objective.
 For our purposes, we use local neighborhood to mean the jurisdictions that
 are spatially proximate.
 For a different purpose, one might alternatively define 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to be similarity in industrial base, or demographic composition, or some
 other variable set of interest.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In a manner quite similar to omission of temporal dependency, omitting
 spatial dependency can lead to false signals.
 Does a given jurisdiction respond to the TEL constraint as the spatially-static
 model suggests, or is the measured response a function of the actions of
 neighbors? The smaller the jurisdiction, the greater the influence of overlappi
ng populations, commercial activity, and shared resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flexibility afforded by policy abstraction and the reduction in error
 associated with county-specific stress indicators along with the modeling
 of spatial dependence clearly separate this analysis from those that have
 preceded it.
 Whether or not these innovations change the picture painted by previous
 literature, they seek to account for potentially confounding elements in
 the measurement space.
 In so doing, agreement would serve only to bolster the robustness of earlier
 findings.
 More importantly, however, these approaches (of which this study provides
 only a test drive) open the door for a wider scope of inquiry than was
 available with the binary and index approaches.
 In particular, the incorporation of jurisdictional variation in impact
 helps local policymakers to better understand policy implications for their
 own specific circumstance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is the Spatial Scope of Analysis?
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:SpatialScope"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The geographic scope of this study is the State of Colorado.
 It was chosen because it features what is widely regarded as one of the
 most restrictive TEL regimes in the United States.
 TABOR, specifically, is often mentioned in the same breath as California's
 Proposition 13 and Massachusetts' Proposition 2
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$
\backslash
frac{1}{2}$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 when describing what a restrictive regime looks like.
 That being said, TABOR is just one piece of the puzzle.
 The TEL landscape also includes the Gallagher Amendment (GA) and the Statewide
 Limitation on Property Tax Revenue (SLPTR), two additional restrictions
 that act upon local governments.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Colorado features additional restrictions like Amendment 23 and policies
 acting on the state level.
 This analysis, thus, represents only a partial representation of the entire
 landscape.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 All three of these policies have significant implications for the property
 tax, which is the dominant element of own-source revenue for local governments
 in the state.
 As a consequence of this intersection, the impact on property tax revenue
 is the dominant focus for operationalizing the impact of these policies.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
So enters an implicit assumption that is less than ideal.
 TABOR actually has broader revenue scope than SLPTR and GA, but the constructio
n of the composite constraint used in the empirical modeling requires a
 common object upon which the policies can act.
 The property tax serves that role, and therefore acts as a proxy in the
 TABOR case for the dynamics associated with the broader revenue portfolio.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Counties serve as the unit of analysis for a number of reasons.
 First, general purpose jurisdictions are convenient insofar as they feature
 greater variety in service responsibilities.
 To understand the impact of TELs on expenditure behavior (the second research
 objective), this variation will prove useful because it facilitates identificat
ion of differential impacts from TELs.
 Suppose an extreme case in which we have classified expenditure behavior
 into only high and low expenditure categories.
 We may be able to extract a good sense of the likelihood of a TEL pushing
 a jurisdiction into one category or the other, but determining the precise
 magnitude of the shift is less straightforward.
 Increasing the number of categories or switching to interval expenditure
 data
\begin_inset Foot

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 helps us answer that question.
 Splitting the expenditure into more functions refines our understanding
 even better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, counties are favored over municipalities for reasons of spatial
 parsimony.
 There are 62 counties in Colorado, and two consolidated city-county governments
 (Denver and Broomfield).
 For the purposes of this study, Denver and Broomfield are also treated
 as counties.
 This choice reflects the fact that Denver and Broomfield

\begin_layout Plain Layout
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Broomfield County was created
 from parts of Adams, Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld counties effective November
 15, 2001.
 Estimates from BEA for Broomfield began in 2002.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 do not overlap, nor are they overlapped by, the conventional counties in
 the state.
 Moreover, this collection of 64 jurisdictions represents a spatially-exhaustive
 set of jurisdictional units.
 Municipalities do not feature these properties, nor do they consistently
 nest within counties.
 Thus, the use of municipalities would complicate the analysis substantially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third reason, and perhaps the most important, relates to the allocation
 of levy responsibility for the property tax.
 As we will see, property taxes are the dominant form of own-source revenue.
 Counties generally collect a greater share of property taxes relative to
 the other major general purpose jurisdictional form: municipalities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, counties are also analytically convenient from a data availability
 standpoint.
 Data are collected extensively at the county-level by both state and federal
 statistical authorities.
 At the state level, the information used in this study is collected by
 the Colorado State Division of Local Affairs.
 They provide excellent, standardized fiscal information and limited demographic
 information over the study window.
 The federal sources (predominately the US Census Bureau) do not feature
 the same reporting frequency in some cases, but the set of socioeconomic
 variables is much greater than that which is collected by the state.

 The end date, by contrast, reflects a less conceptually relevant rationale.
 At the start of the this inquiry, the latest available data in the Colorado
 County and Municipal Financial Compendium was for 2009.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will become apparent in what follows that TELs are much like sledgehammers.
 If binding, they can have large effects on the fiscal behavior of affected
 jurisdictions, producing foundational shifts in the trajectories of revenues
 and expenditures.
 Precision, however, is not the a major strength of the approach.
 They can just as easily create structural imbalances as combat waste, fraud
 and abuse perpetuated by local officials.
 And yet, by all accounts, they are quite popular.
 The student of fiscal affairs must consider why this is the case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Canonical public finance is taught from a perspective of the state as an
 exogenous actor.
 The unfettered market, while a remarkably useful mechanism, is characterized
 by certain problematic defects that limit its ability to produce desirable
 outcomes.
 Public policy is typically proposed
\emph on
 to counteract these market failures.

\emph default
 The very idea that such a thing is possible requires a belief in our ability
 to objectively observe and diagnose a problem, and redirect activity.
 It requires a belief in the ability of the state to act on the economy
 from the outside.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Their viewpoint could still be framed in a public versus private context.
 In reality, this is a gross oversimplification.
 It is convenient to frame the tradeoffs between private and public action
 as two forces acting against each other, but Buchanan did in fact view
 the state as solely a collection of rules and institutions, as is made
 clear in the appendix of the 2004 reprinting of the book (published by
 Liberty Fund, Inc).
 This conception was critical to his distinction between positive and normative
 theories of politics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\end_inset

A positive science of politics should analyze the operation of an existing,
 or a postulated, set of rules for collective decision-making quite independent
 of the efficacy of this set in furthering or in promoting certain 'social
 goals'.
 A normative theory of politics should, by contrast, array the alternative
 sets of rules in accordance with their predicted efficiency in producing
 certain ends or goals which should be, if possible, made quite explicit.

The analysis in this study is generally built on the orthodox view, but
 we should at least momentarily consider a reframing of public action that
 may make the proliferation of TELs somewhat easier to understand.
 Richard Wagner suggests that perhaps it is inappropriate to think of the
 market and state as actors.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Neither construct actually does anything at all.
 Rather, they are regulatory constructs the govern the allowable actions

 To borrow his terminology, they are not actors, but fora.

When viewed from this angle,

 on the market if the two fora are populated by different people.

\emph default
 The ability to separate these groups is a function of the governance structure
 that prevails in a society at a given time.
 Monarchy serves as the primary example of a governance structure that allows
 for separability.
 Indeed, Wagner suggests that our monarchal roots are the cause for the
 orthodox view.
 In a democratic society, however, separability does not hold.
 The same people operate in both the state and market fora.
 The only distinction is that each forum has its own set of operational
 rules that differentiate how each facilitates the extraction and processing
 of resources into services for the public.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Viewed from this angle, the task of the state does not exist.
 The task of the public is to design state rules that better align services
 rendered with its preferences, from within the existing, yet mutable, set
 of rules
\emph on
.

\emph default
 Institutional rules are complex and, importantly, are not conducive to
 smooth adjustment as a function of societal welfare.
 That is, there is no straightforward way to change the rules in a way that
 maps exactly to the optimal welfare value for a collection of people.
 If a jurisdiction increases taxes on cigarettes, the measurement of the
 welfare impact must take into account consumers, producers, and all of
 the market participants' auxiliary activity related to the production and
 consumption of cigarettes.
 This view is complicated by knock on effects, as well as the existence
 and regulation of many other products and services.
 Furthermore, it turns out that welfare is difficult to measure to begin
 with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choice of rules must also contend with the issue of degradation.
 For its noble beginnings and the important benefits still conferred today,
 the American version of democracy is not without its challenges.
 To choose only one aspect, equal representation is more easily idealized
 than realized.
 In the modern political age, it has become clear that even the definition
 of equal representation is fairly unclear.
 At the base, we can all agree on a single vote for each voter.
 The ability, however, to influence the agenda confers great benefits on
 those who successfully leverage said influence.
 Attempts to limit that power, however, are hamstrung by the need to apply
 rules in a general way.
 Designing rules that do not also abridge basic rights is a significant
 challenge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this context, ballot initiatives like those that produce tax and expenditure
 limitations, blunt as though they may be, emerge as a method of circumventing
 the agenda setting power of established interest groups that have refined
 their ability to influence the policymaking process.
 They are seen as enhancing the role of the public in a democratic mechanism
 that must deal with some thorny issues.
 To be sure, interest groups have strong influence in promoting the passage
 or failure of these initiatives.
 From the perspective of the voter, however, the at least apparent civic
 return may outweigh any lack of precision associated with the instruments.
 Furthermore, and this is important, even if the mix of outcomes is not
 quite right, the central tendency may be more in line with the voter's
 preference than the outcomes generated by conventional means.
 Whether or not all of the variables are appropriately weighed in decisions
 about these tradeoffs is an empirical question.

 The national and state governments account for only 51 of these entities.
 Aside from a handful of territories, the remaining entities constitute
 the remarkably diverse local government sector.
 In broad terms, to borrow the Census classification, these governmental
 units are split into five classes: counties, municipalities, townships,
 school districts and special districts.
 These local governments vary in population size and composition, resource

In his treatise,

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, Professor Musgrave constructed a framework for conceptualizing public
 finance in a federal system that has proven robust to a remarkably varied
 set of research inquiries.
 This framework once again proves useful in explaining the significance
 of subnational finance in the US.
 Musgrave's approach defines three primary tasks for the public sector in
 an economy, and allocates those functions to the appropriate level of governmen
t.
 For the purposes of this analysis, the front end of the framework (function
 definition) proves directly applicable while some modification of the back
 end (allocation of functions) may be needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Musgrave, there are three primary roles for the public sector:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Direct service delivery (i.e.
 allocation);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Redistribution of resources; and,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Macroeconomic stabilization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first (allocation) is the direct product of government operation, the
 most direct link to taxes paid.
 The second (redistribution) seeks to adjust resource allocations to accord
 with societal preferences for distributional equity.
 An additional motivation for this function can be the mitigation of damages
 that have occured due to trade.
 Insofar as the cost-benefit calculation from a trade is typically considered
 beneficial whether or not the gains help to offset the losses experienced
 by ill-placed parties
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hicks39,Kaldor39"

\end_inset

, losses are free to occur by construction.
 The third function (stabilization) seeks to maintain an environment conducive
 to achieving the full potential of economic output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it turns out, these three functions cannot be cleanly assigned to the
 three levels of government (federal, state, and local).
 Indeed, comparatively recent literature
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bahl1984,Gramlich1993"

\end_inset

 suggests that the discord is even greater than Musgrave had originally
 believed.
 In any event, there is broad agreement that the preponderance of direct
 service provision occurs at the level closest to the recipients of services:
 local.
 Indeed, this de facto postulate is the supporting force behind Oates' Decentral
ization Theorem

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It should be noted that Professor Oates would argue, and has argued (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

), that Tiebout sorting is not a prerequisite for the Decentralization Theorem.
 Mobility is not required for the latter to have an effect.
 I would argue, however, that even if unnecessary, Tiebout sorting improves
 the efficacy of the Decentralization Theorem in the sense that mobility
 increases the systemic capacity to match supply and demand in the local
 taxation-expenditure bundle market.

For a public good - the consumption of which is defined over geographical
 subsets of the total population, and for which the costs of providing each
 level of the good are the same for the central or for the respective local
 government - it will always be more efficient (or at least as efficient)
 for local governments to provide Pareto-efficient levels of output for
 their respective jurisdictions than for the central government to provide
 any specified and uniform level of output across all jurisdictions.

Perusal of budgets across the three levels of government will affirm that
 direct service provision constitutes larger portions of the budget the
 closer one gets to the citizens.
 This is a good thing because the capacity to choose among local menus is
 welfare enhancing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Direct service provision serves as the nexus at which the taxpayer realizes
 the connection between tax price and the return from that investment.
 Indeeed, this intuitive dictum accords with an argument that substantially
 predates Musgraves' revelation.
 The nascent stages of our republic were characterized by fierce deliberation
 over the capacity to govern such a geographically expansive jurisdiction.
 The concern raised by so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 was the idea that it was simply not possible to govern a space of this
 size because representatives could not feasibly identify with the populations
 they were elected to represent.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Storing1981"

\end_inset

 Again, the issue was contact.
 Supporting direct service delivery (a role that is critical not only to
 public finance, but also democracy) requires a vehicle by which said activities
 can propagate.
 That is, the resources to deliver these services must be reliably generated
 from a viable and stable revenue source.

 It is this variety that provides a vehicle for demand articulation within
 the public sphere.
 Insofar as taxpayers are free to choose among a set of taxation-expenditure
 bundles, the system intrinsically seeks to minimize the deadweight loss
 associated with coerced conformity.
 Tiebout sorting requires some unrealistic assumptions in perfect information
 and costless mobility, but there does appear to be empirical support for
 the occurrence of sorting.

While this does look promising, Ross and Yinger note that homogeneity as

 results are also consistent with the consensus bidding framework.
 Schmidt, however, does find evidence that increased income heterogeneity

 This result is consistent with the predictions of the Henderson model

 The implication here (albeit weak) is that public service preferences,
 rather than home values, drive sorting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An extensive review of the sorting literature is beyond the scope of this
 inquiry.
 However, if we believe the sorting narrative that has provided the basis
 for much of the literature over the last half century, then the capacity
 to finance a tax-expenditure bundle consistent with the preferences of
 the residents in a particular jurisdiction is essential.

Having established the operational handles of an abstract local tax, the
 choice of specific taxes should strive to capture the ideal elements of
 such a tax: immobility, adequacy/buoyancy, stabilty/predictability, fairness,
 administrative ease, non-exportality, and visibility (i.e.
 transparency).
 For the most part, these characteristics are goals for any tax at any level.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that these are theoretical objectives for tax design, identified for
 the purpose of maintaining a tight coupling between revenue generation
 and expenditure allocation.
 Such a coupling seeks to create a tight response for taxpayers, so that
 they may link the costs they feel from taxes with the benefits of service
 delivery in a manner that minimizes noise from other factors.
 The stronger this linkage, the greater the capacity for taxpayers to equalize
 costs and benefits at the margin.
 In practice, however, political expediency has an outsized role in the
 selection of available revenue handles, and can distort the role of other
 characteristics.
 For example, from a political perspective, exportability becomes an asset
 for those promoting a given tax.

 In the revenue schema of fiscal federalism established by Oates in 1972

 (and subsequently supported by Bird, Gramlich, and others), the idea of
 open and closed jurisdictions plays a prominent role.
 Closed jurisdictions are characterized by sufficiently high exit costs
 as to discourage departure from the jurisdiction over a wide range of tax
 prices.
 While the national government may feature this property, local governments
 do not.
 Local governments must contend with open borders, also known as low costs
 of exit.
 It is for this reason that a graduated income tax with comparable progressivity
 to the national model does not exist at the subnational level.
 Local officials are worried that taxpayers may simply choose to reside
 somewhere else.
 In this light, the fixed nature of real property makes it an attractive
 base upon which to levy a local tax.

 side of public finance in his writings.

Revenue systems cannot, and should not, be divorced from the public services

 Though this fact was recognized with the advent of marginal utility economics

 Too often we see tax discussions without thought to programmatic impacts

 The ultimate systemic impact on revenue performance and utilization is

Economic activity, as used here, captures both the value generated from
 transactional interactions among economic actors and the change in capital
 value associated with said transactions.
 For example, many buyers and sellers in a local real estate market generate
 value with marginal returns to each transaction on average.
 Such a market is also likely to see increases in the value of the housing
 stock as a whole.
 Both are functions of underlying demand, which would be depressed in a
 recession.

For good cause, the intergovernmental transfer system has emerged as a method
 of mitigating the intrinsic difficulties in local revenue generation and
 expenditure responsibility.
 Local governments must contend with mobile tax bases, and often expenditure
 needs that are geographically out of phase with revenue capacity.
 The downside of this development is a strong dependency by local governments
 on transfers from both state and national coffers.
 When the economy enters a recession, while the impacts on own source revenue
 may differ as a function of revenue base disparities, a certain amount
 of conditional correlation in revenue yield occurs.
 Not only are local fund sources depressed, but state and national governments
 are far less able to provide the same contribution via transfers.
 States are far more constrained given prevailing balanced budget requirements,
 but national governments can also be constrained (particularly given pre-existi
ng debt or more pressing political factors).

 Not all TELs bind the revenue raising capacity of local governments.
 If, for example, a TEL restricts growth in assessment ratios, local fiscal

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Lack of Uniformity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tax is not actually an ad valorem tax in the sense that it is not levied
 on a fixed percentage of property value.
 Instead, the assessment ratio and/or tax rate are calculated in a way that
 takes the taxing jurisdiction's desired total levy as a primary argument.
 This construct creates the capacity for significant variation in burdens
 across jurisdictions, due to the variations in fiscal requirements.
 The result is horizontal inequity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Lack of Universality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite numerous historical attempts to create a general purpose tax (which
 Seligman discusses in some detail), the practical problem of capturing
 personal property in a way that is commensurate with levies on real property
 creates disparities in burden that are driven by occupational genre rather
 than ability to pay or benefits received.
 These practical problems are a function of both political manipulation
 and the difficulty in getting a handle on intangible/administratively inconveni
ent personal property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Incentive for Dishonesty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When entire classes of property are exempt from taxation, Seligman correctly
 argues that avoidance incentives are high.
 The rational taxpayer will shift assets to protected classes whenever possible.
 In many cases, such practices have exerted pressure on, or entirely breached,
 the boundary between avoidance and evasion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Regressivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seligman's context for this complaint involved his observance of the transition
 away from the agrarian social context that characterized the early period
 in US history.
 In particular, farmers were disadvantaged in the practical taxation of
 property because their assets were quite intangible and visible.
 In contrast, holdings derived from trade often enjoyed tax exempted status,
 either de facto or de jure, as a consequence of their intractability as
 administratively feasible tax handles.
 Since trading wealth often exceeded that which was derived from agriculture,
 this feature was a regressive one.
 This framework holds today in the sense that personal property can drive
 a tremendous wedge in aggregate asset holdings across homeowners.
 To the extent that personal property is taxed inconsistently at best, Seligman'
s concerns are still valid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Double Taxation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Property is taxed in practice based upon the value of the asset,
\emph on
 not the value of the property owned by the taxpayer.

\emph default
 Insofar as the development of modern finance techniques has bifurcated
 equity stakes in a given piece of property, the individual that physically
 holds the asset is being taxed on his/her property

 and the property which is owned by the financial entity that has provided
 the liquidity for the taxpayer to buy the asset.

\emph default
 This was perhaps Seligman's most significant condemnation because it identified
 a structural phenomenon with the potential to divorce the basis of taxation
 from an individual's ability to pay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Periodicity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the sales tax which is levied at the point of sale, and the income
 tax which is largely withheld, the property tax stands out for the timing
 of payments.
 Property tax payments are collected rarely and are correspondingly large
 when collected.
 This creates a very high level of visibility of property tax liability,
 and the economic pain of payment is comparatively acute.
 From a theoretical standpoint,

 In particular, the productivity of the property tax as practiced was the
 source of a new lease on life.
 That is, the expanding role for the state was well-served by the reliable
 revenue provided by the property tax.
 It should also be noted that the property tax, due to the timing of the
 assessment/collection cycle, has favorable cyclical properties.
 As a practical matter, local officials must be concerned with the decline
 in revenue associated with economic downturns.
 As a consequence of assessment lag, the property tax will typically not
 decline in yield immediately (as would income and sales taxes).
 The delay helps to smooth local revenue profiles and lessen the impact
 of macro-level shocks.

Bolstered by the strong practical rationale for continued reliance on the
 property tax, scholars have taken note of strong theoretical arguments.
 As previously mentioned, the immobility of the property tax base reduces
 concerns regarding the flight of the tax base from a given jurisdiction.
 Furthermore, the property tax can be supported from a benefits received

 While there are difficulties coupling liability to home value, on the public

Thus, while we can advance the economic critique of reform movements and

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

political economy approach to fiscal federalism.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 It differs from the fiscal federalism approach that Oates advanced in 1972,
 largely due to differing evaluations of two key assumptions.
 First, traditional fiscal federalism assumes that officials seek to maximize
 the welfare of the jurisdiction they serve.
 This pursuit leads naturally to strong welfare gains as a consequence of
 local variation, leading to tax-expenditure bundles that can be better
 tailored to local conditions.
 The political economy approach makes no such assumption, leaving room for
 political calculation that may be out of phase with actual maximization
 of constituent welfare.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Perrson_Tabellini2000,Besley_Case1995"

\end_inset

 Second, the political economy literature does not assume, as traditional
 fiscal federalism does, that central provision implies uniform public output.
 Variations in output can and do arise from the legislative process and
 the insertion of non-neutralities.
 These non-neutralities typically arise as a consequence of the variety
 of political power endowments and cultivation efforts across local jurisdiction
s.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 I would extend this further to remark that, in the context of varying local
 conditions, the effect of non-neutralities is far from clear cut.
 Moreover, variance in local implementation carries its own additional source
 of variance in public outputs.

 Although the institutional reforms have limited the efficacy of the property

Admittedly, Proposition 13 was a particularly aggressive limitation effort.
 It does serve, however, to demonstrate the types of impacts that can occur
 with these reforms.
 Such effects do not occur everywhere, particularly when reforms are not
 of the binding variety defined by Mullins and Joyce.
 Binding limitations provide no workaround to achieve the same revenue targets.
 A two-part composite reform created this environment in California.
 Passed on June 2, 1978, Proposition 13 limited assessment increases to
 2% annually and mandated a rate ceiling of 1%.
 Rather than address the revenue yield directly, voters chose to limit the
 base and rate inputs.
 Furthermore, assessed values reverted back to 1976 levels.
 Couple this reduction in the base with the practice of acquisition value
 assessement, in which real estate values only reflect the market value
 at the time of sale, and one gets a potent mix for revenue reduction.

 Although it is less of a concern at the state and local level, fees and

 Such a shift implies a reduction in local autonomy, which has implications
 for the ability of local officials to respond to the preferences of constituent
s.
 To the extent that local officials can negotiate with state officials instead
 of ask constituents to raise more revenue, the link between local preferences
 and local service delivery is weakened.
 Direct connection between own-source revenue and services rendered promotes
 better assessment of the opportunity costs associated with local policies.
 That being said, the extent of this offset is limited when TELs operate
 on both state and local governments

, Cutler et al.
 found that the impacts of the TEL were smaller than anticipated during
 the 1980s.
 The intended reduction in local revenue collection was offset by an increase
 in the tax base from new construction, and increased state aid to municipal
 governments.
 However, when a recession hit in the early 1990s, new construction slowed
 and the state was less willing to provide offsetting transfers.
 The impact of Proposition 2

 Indeed, the strength of the policy in general has been explicitly weakened
 with amendments.
 One such amendment increased the levy limit to account for new construction.
 Another permitted local voters to choose to collect more revenue.
 In Colorado, TABOR features both of these innovations.

 They found that communities constrained by the limit were unable to finance
 increases in school expenditures.
 Moreover, they showed that school expenditures were capitalized into the
 home prices within a given community.
 Communities that could not match these increases experienced adverse impacts
 on the value of their housing stock.
 Thus, in addition to the equity concerns associated with the differential
 impact of TELs across communities, there are downstream effects that may
 exacerbate preexisting inequity.

With respect to the tax base, as expected, the number of housing units scales
 tightly with population.
 Interestingly enough, however, the highest value housing tends to reside

 Home values do not scale tightly with population, which may suggest that
 the desire for land scales with income.
 Most counties contain less than 100,000 people, further supporting the
 notion that outlier counties are driving the population growth.
 The distribution of housing stock value is characterized by a high level

 billion.
 The largest single source of tax revenue was the property tax.
 Local governments collected over $8 billion in property tax revenue, approximat
ely 67.5% of tax revenue and 28.0% of total revenue.
 Sales and gross receipts revenue, the next largest source of own-source
 revenue, accounted for $3.3 billion.

 Overall, county revenue increased by 72% over the period on average (from

 These measures of central tendency, however, mask considerable variation
 in the individual trajectories of specific counties.
 The average range of per capita revenue was $3,772 over the same period.
 Note also that the median revenue per capita increase (63%) did not significant
ly lag the mean increase, suggesting a relatively stable distribution of
 county revenue across time.

Somewhat surprisingly, the growth in tax receipts (+187%) over the period
 outpaced growth in intergovernmental transfers (+42%).

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In fairness, however, the target of these TELs is usually the property
 tax.
 While the property tax has grown in terms of receipts (+168%), it has fallen
 as a percentage of total tax revenue (-6.5%).
 Moreover, the growth in sales revenue as a percentage of all tax revenues
 has increased dramatically (+30%).
 It has also stood out as the fastest growing revenue source (+273%).
 Although it remains a small portion of the overall portfolio, license revenue
 grew faster than all other sources (+489%), followed by revenue from charges
 (+406%).
 This growth is consistent with the expected impacts of TEL policies.

The Colorado Division of Local Affairs provides 2010 fiscal data for counties
 and municipalities.
 Relative to the Census data, these data permit a more nuanced view of the
 functions served by general purpose jurisdictions in the state.
 There are three particularly noteworthy insights revealed by the data.
 First, property taxes are the revenue source most directly impacted by
 TELs, and they are predominately levied by county level governments.
 Second, taxes in general are far and away the dominant sources of revenue
 for general purpose jurisdictions.
 Third, counties play a major role in the direct delivery of services.
 All three of these facts suggest that policies that impact the property
 tax, in particular, have substantial potential to directly affect the public

While debt service has been the fastest growing liability for counties in
 Colorado (+633%), it still remains a small portion of the overall budget

 this is unsurprising.
 Operating expenditures increased 116% over the period, but fell as a percentage

 Within operating expenditures, the fastest growing line item was judicial
 expenditure (+263%), although it constituted only 3.6% of operating expenditures

 The real story is in public safety, which grew 231% over the period.

 level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While multiple limits act at the state level, our focus for this analysis
 is local revenue behavior.
 In particular, we are concerned with the property tax, which has stood
 out over time as the most important revenue source for local governments.
 For this reason, we will further unpack the three most significant reforms
 in this areas a bit further: TABOR, SLPTR, and GA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Taxpayer's Bill of Rights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TABOR is, in and of itself, a composite measure that acts on individual
 tax districts.
 Tax districts in this case represent local jurisdictions that raise revenue,
 such as general purposes municipalities, counties, and school districts.
 It features three major elements that work in concert to limit revenue
 growth: voter approval for tax increases, a limitation on the growth in
 revenue, and protection of the existing limits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the purposes of TABOR, a tax increase is defined as any one of the following
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
New tax instrument;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tax rate increase;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Local mill levy increase;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Property assessment valuation ratio increase;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Extension of an expiring tax; or,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Any tax policy resulting in a net tax revenue gain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If any of the above are proposed, they must be validated by explicit voter
 approval in the jurisdiction in question.
 On the other side, no voter approval is required for a tax decrease.
 Note, however, that such a decrease resets the baseline to a new, lower
 level.
 This is one manifestation of the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ratchet effect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which will be explored further below.
 TABOR also explicitly prohibits some types of new taxes.
\begin_inset Foot

Prohibited taxes include new or increased real estate transfers, local income
 taxes, state property taxes, and surcharges on state income taxes.

 which generally accounts for increases in inflation
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Consumer Price Index serves as the inflation measure.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and some measure of growth.
 At the state level, revenue growth is limited to CPI plus population growth.
 For local general purpose districts, growth is limited to CPI plus growth
 in the volume of jurisdictional housing stock.
 School districts, by contrast, are bound by CPI growth plus growth in school
 enrollment.
 Any surplus revenue must be returned to taxpayers as credits or refunds.
 
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that at the state level, the revenue subject to TABOR (a.k.a.
 the TABOR base) constituted only 58.5% of the entire budget in the FY02-03
 fiscal cycle.
 The two largest sources were the individual income, sales, and use taxes.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TABOR also raised the bar for efforts to modify existing limitations.
 Prior to its passage, ABL could have been weakened by a simple majority
 vote in the General Assembly.
 TABOR requires explicit voter approval for changes to ABL or any other
 limitations.
 This element of the reform is viewed by Colorado legislative analysts as
 being incorporated with ABL specifically in mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps the most restrictive feature of TABOR is the implicit 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ratchet effect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If, in a given year, revenue fails to exhaust the allowable increase, the
 new baseline is set at a lower level.
 For example, if in year zero a jurisdiction received $100 million in revenue,
 and the CPI plus the growth factor totaled 6% in the allowable increase,
 the TABOR limit is $106 million in year one.
 Similar inflation and growth activity in the following year would allow
 for approximately $112.4 million in year two.
 If, perhaps for economic reasons, only $105 million is actually collected
 in year one, the maximum allowable revenue in year two would be $111.3 million.
 Thus, failing to hit the limit in a given year has a dynamic effect, forever
 lowering the baseline growth trajectory of revenue.
 This becomes problematic when expenditures are out of phase with revenues.

 DeBrucing is the process by which a local government can vote on whether
 or not its tax base should be subject to the constraints of TABOR.
 One may consider this override capacity to be a robust safety valve, sufficient
 to invalidate any claims of undue restriction imposed by reform.
 If a jurisdiction can actually vote to exempt itself from reform, how can
 it impact fiscal choices? The analysis that follows will reveal that there
 is indeed a very real impact from this reform that results in observable
 impacts on the revenue and expenditure behavior of affected jurisdictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ultimately, despite initially appearing to be an analytic liability, the
 existence of deBrucing emerges as an opportunity for greater estimating
 precision.
 In particular, the practice provides an important source of horizontal
 variation, allowing us to more cleanly separate macroeconomic conditions
 from the policy structure.
 The nature of this separation will be considered in further detail in Subsectio

Statewide Limitation of Property Tax Revenue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above, the SLPTR is among the oldest limitations in Colorado.
 It was originally enacted in 1913, but its most recent level (5.5%) is a
 vestige of its last modification in 1988.
 The structure of the limit, a constant ceiling, is quite straightforward.
 For our purposes, the interest is in how this limit interacts with TABOR.
 To the extent that the TABOR limit may be above or below 5.5% in any given
 year for a given county, we must account for variation in which limit binds
 over time.

\begin_layout Standard
In response to a dramatic increase in residential property values and the

 voters passed House Concurrent Resolution 82-1005 in 1982.
 It included the following elements:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An assessment rate of 29% for nonresidential property;
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The State Board of Equalization, tasked with evaluating property tax valuation
 schemes; and,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Gallagher Amendment (GA).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the residential assessment rate reduction, GA provided a
 dynamic relief mechanism for residential property taxpayers.
 GA automatically adjusts the residential assessment rate each year to hold
 the residential share of total assessed value constant.
 That is, even when residential assessment growth outpaces nonresidential
 assessment growth, the proportion of the property tax paid by residential
 taxpayers will not increase as a result.
 That being said, modification is allowed in the event of new construction.
 In other words,
\emph on
 the residential share of property taxes in Colorado cannot increase as
 a consequence of an increase in tax unit value (the intensive margin),
 but it can increase when the number of tax units increases (the extensive
 margin).

\emph default
 Modification of the rate for new construction has been limited in practice.
 The residential share of assessment value was approximately 45% when GA
 was implemented in 1982.
 As of 2003, the rate had only increased to 47%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The residential assessment rate imposed via GA is calculated based upon
 the aggregate assessed values in the state.
 Thus, the rates are calculated in a manner which masks substantial variation
 in growth profiles and the mix of properties in individual counties.
 Indeed, we will leverage this variation in modeling the impact of reform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also important to note that TABOR has has an impact on how GA works
 in practice.
 Prior to TABOR's passage, if non-residential property increased in value
 at a rate greater than residential property, residential assessment rates
 could be adjusted upward automatically to maintain the statewide ratio
 of residential to non-residential assessment.
 After TABOR, assessment increases were counted as tax increases, and thus
 required explicit voter approval.
 In this way, TABOR not only introduces TABOR-specific asymmetric pressure
 (it is easier to lower than raise taxes), but it also produces asymmetric
 interaction effects with other policies.

\end_inset

Cross-state studies have all but neglected an assessment of the effects
 of tax and expenditure limitations on the fiscal structure within the local
 public sector.
 Even within the ranks of the individual state studies, there has been limited
 attention to these types of effects.
 While results point to the use of alternative revenue sources and intergovernme
ntal transfers, effects on the actual composition and response of the local
 public sector are largely absent.
 Have tax and expenditure limitations changed the face of the local public
 sector and its interaction with local populations? Has it done so uniformly?
 And what are the implications of any of these structural changes for local
 governance? [...] The outcome with regard to local discretion may be one of
 asymmetric truncation of the ability to exercise local choice, such that
 the variation in service availability across jurisdictions increases.
 While this increased variation may superficially appear as Tiebout inspired,
 it will be driven not by responsiveness to local desires, but by a reinforcemen
t of differential abilities to respond.

The author would be hard pressed to state the implications of the change
 in focus any better.
 In effect, incorporation of local characteristics changes the types of
 questions that one seeks to answer.
 Instead trying to extrapolate from average effects, conditional analysis
 provides more actionable intelligence to local fiscal managers trying to
 understand how tax and expenditure limitations affect their own jurisdiction,
 and the implications for how they serve their constituents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Surprisingly, there has been relatively little additional work over the
 decade since Mullins' piece that sought to evaluate differential impacts
 based upon local conditions.
 Subsequent research that has cited the article generally extracts the associati
on between TELs and both the general propensity to shift revenue sources
 outside of the jurisdiction and a difficult environment for the collection
 of fiscal resources.
 One Colorado focused study explored the deleterious effects of recessions
 for jurisdictions affected by TABOR

The author posits that this lack of work is driven in large part by the
 limitations of the methods used to measure the impact of TELs.
 Though we have learned a great deal from the approach, measurement has
 largely been conducted within the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

existence paradigm
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 That is, TEL effect is generally represented as a binary indicator or some
 close derivative.
 Even Mullins (2004), path breaking though it may be, employs a refinement
 of this technique.

This work measures TEL effect as a discrete variable which, at different
 points in the analysis, reflects simple existence, the extent of the TEL's
 binding nature, and/or the scope of the TEL's application.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 One limitation of this approach is the inability to model certain kinds
 of interactions between overlapping TELs.
 This is particularly relevant, as we will see, in the context of TABOR
 and SLPTR.
 Another limitation is the inability to differentiate the cumulative effect
 of a TEL regime across counties.
 In other words, there is little reason to believe that, given differing
 socioeconomic dynamics, five years under a TEL regime for county A will
 have the same implications as five years under a TEL regime for county
 B.
 Both limitations constrain the direct applicability of findings for local
 fiscal managers.

\begin_layout Standard
The solution proposed here is abstraction away from the specific elements
 of the TELs in Colorado (COTELs) as the basis for operationalization.
 Rather, this study captures COTEL design indirectly, by evaluating the
 implications of COTELs for local revenue yield.
 By shifting the focus, we can overcome the aforementioned limitations.
 In effect, we want to capture some measure of COTEL intensity that captures
 three primary characteristics of a given county at time

\begin_layout Standard
The indicator used in a previous version of the analysis in the first empirical
 section was simply an ordinal score that captured information on the first
 two characteristics.
 Effectively, the score added a point for each additional constraint.
 For example, all counties in 1987 would have a score of two given the general
 application of SLPTR and GA.
 The scores were subsequently modified by deBrucing, which occurred to some
 degree in 47 of 64 counties over the 1993-2009 time period.
 If only one of the policies was exempted, only one point would be removed.
 In effect, it was a cumulative indicator function.
 The reason it has value now is because it provided a clear view of the
 variety of policy application across counties (Figure

While this score was a useful starting point, the subsequent measure incorporate
s the county-specific dynamics captured in the third desired characteristic:
 the likelihood of a binding constraint.
 The new score was constructed based upon comparing the property tax base
 growth to the limit imposed by the conjunction of SLPTR and TABOR limits
 when both apply in a given year.
 If only one or the other applies (due to deBrucing) in a given county-year,
 then the limit is just that which is imposed by the policy in effect.
 The construction of a composite limitation variable is useful because

 only one of the limits can be binding in any given county-year.

 The approach taken leverages the relationship in Equation

 to back into market value, which is a useful figure for thinking about
 economic activity in a county.
 It is important to note that because assessments are generally susceptible
 to discretionary definition, the assessment base can generally become uncoupled
 with market value.
 In this instance, however, the potential for this decoupling is reduced.
 In the absence of a deBrucing vote, local officials cannot raise revenue
 by changing assessment rates or values.
 The real deficiency with this approach is the downside risk.
 Assessment values can decline if the yield is too high.
 Thus, it is certainly not a perfect proxy for value, but it is a better
 fit than it would be in other situations.
 In interpreting the analysis, one must also recognize that assessments
 take into account exemptions, which decrease the assessment value by a
 fixed amount relative to market value.

 is of particular interest, the hypothesis here being that it captures a
 growing disparity between the economic activity that occurs in a given
 county and the governmental capacity to facilitate and/or regulate said
 activity.
 For example, one would expect it to be more costly to govern a county of
 50,000 people relative to a county of 1,000 people.
 There are simply more interactions, both social and economic, to mediate.
 The need for infrastructure grows, as does the need to finance a larger
 educational demand.
 These constraints, then, act as an instrument to decouple the trajectories
 of revenue potential and expenditure need.
 The author expects this to be a dynamic effect.

It is important to recognize that the intensity measurements will generally
 be underestimated.
 The reason is that our market value concept is derived directly from the
 assessment value and rate.
 As mentioned previously, increases in assessment must be accompanied by
 a deBrucing vote, so there is a natural obstacle to assessment rates rising
 faster than market values.
 However, since there are no constraints on lowering assessment value, there
 is a threat that assessment values (and thus our concept of market value)
 will grow at a lower rate than actual market value.
 In effect, any findings in this analysis related to TEL intensity are likely
 to be conservative.

\begin_layout Subsection
The Gallagher Ratio
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the actions imposed by TABOR and SLPTR were conceptually similar,
 they lent themselves to integration.
 GA, by constrast, was modeled separately as simply the ratio between the
 residential and non-residential tax bases within a county.
 The idea here was to capture the impact of disparities between county ratios
 and the statewide ratio used to calculate allowable assessment rates.
 If a given county has a higher proportion of residential assessment value
 in its base, we would expect it to have a more difficult time raising revenue,
 since the residential assessment rates are held down to keep them consistent
 across the state.
 Conversely, higher proportions of non-residential assessment value serve
 to subsidize residential taxpayers in a given county, since only so much
 yield is required and their assessment ratios cannot be increased.
 The data required to construct this ratio come from the assessment information
 discussed in Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The distribution of this Gallagher Ratio can be seen in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 substantial variation in the impact of the Gallagher Amendment.

That a given data generating process may yield observations that are related
 to each other is not a new concept by any stretch of the imagination.
 So central has this concern been in the modern practice of statistical
 analysis, large swaths of theoretical development are devoted to methods
 of mitigating this confounding factor.
 The foundational model in econometrics - ordinary least squares - assumes
 it away with the assertion of independent observations for conceptual tractabil
ity.
 The analysis of real world data, however, often necessitates meeting this
 issue head on with a host of models designed to deal with this basic deviation
 from

 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concern centers on the fact that, though approaches differ substantially,
 statistical estimation can generally be distilled down to a search for
 conditional expectation.
 The observed data have some central tendency, and each of the statistically
 significant variables that act on the system cause some sort of deviation
 from that central tendency.
 Measuring the deviation from that baseline expectation requires that the
 baseline be consistent throughout the observational space.
 If one desires to understand the relative heights of five people, he/she
 should either ensure they all stand on level ground, or capture five observatio
n-specific adjustments that yield the same effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important lesson that the field has learned is that variance in this
 baseline is not a deal breaker.
 If the relationship is systemic and estimable, the effect can be accommodated.
 The desire to understand when this stable reference can be relied upon
 is a strong argument for the establishment of stationarity.
 If we know that the relationship between observations follows a consistent
 joint distribution, or some reasonable facsimile, we can reliably estimate
 the impact of variables that impact the system.

Autocorrelation and autoregression are sometimes differentiated in the literatur

 In many cases the former refers to serial correlation in the errors, while
 the latter refers to correlation in observations.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 We will use this distinction in this study, but in reality, scholars often
 use autocorrelation to describe correlation in both the errors and the
 observed values.
 Our definitional split will facilitate discussion of the implications of
 these two behaviors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the split we have defined, the two are not necessarily linked, insofar
 as an autoregressive process is only one potential cause of correlation
 in the error term.
 Other factors, like additional variables that have impacts lasting longer
 than one period, can also contribute to autocorrelation.
 This is a theoretically important distinction, insofar as unbiased estimates
 are still possible with uncorrelated observations, albeit inefficiently.
 In practice, however, they tend to occur jointly.

In fact, as Wold showed, when all the sample serial correlations of the
 [independent variables] are zero the estimates of variance given by the
 least squares method are strictly unbiased whether the errors are serially
 correlated or not.
 It seems to us doubtful, however, whether this result finds much application
 in practice.
 It will only rarely be the case that the independent variables are serially
 uncorrelated while the errors are serially correlated.

If we have a relationship in which the error term is autocorrelated, it

 One method of overcoming this lack of independence is to make the error

 In such cases, we can expect heteroskedasticity to be a function of spatial

 Many phenomenon fit this mold.
 If one were to model the impacts on real estate prices of a given phenomenon,
 one better control for the location specific aspects of the sample.

 Anselin suggests that analysts model both in all cases.

\begin_layout Standard
One might reasonably ask, why bother with the trouble of estimating spatial
 lags? Could we not use a more conventional method like fixed or random
 effects at the county level to control for the impact of neighboring counties?
 There are two reasons why this analysis has not gone this route.
 First, whether it be through repeated cross-sectional or panel analysis,
 this study is concerned with variation in circumstance over time.
 In a fixed effect or random effect world, one is faced with a decision
 about the scope of the effect to remove from each observation.
 If we keep the scope within county and do not vary the effect across time,
 we implicitly assume that the impact of neighbors does not change over
 time.
 If we allow for a two-way effect, we run the risk of washing out the uniqueness
 of the county.
 Remaining variable impacts would be of note, but the effect would likely
 be muted.
 Modeling neighborhood impacts directly avoids wrestling with these unpleasantri
es, at least in the context of neighborhood effects.
 To be sure, fixed effects are employed in some situations that follow,
 but direct modeling of neighborhood effects gives us more flexibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, fixed and random effects are both model parameters to be estimated.
 Consequently, in these situations, we must be concerned with degrees of
 freedom.
 Generally, the safe bet is to have many observations per group, so that
 said parameters may be reliably estimated.
 In the two-way scenario above, we wittle that observation count down to
 one for each county-year effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, fixed and random effects are useful 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

catch-alls
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when the model is incorrectly specified.
 They are meant to be proxies for those elements that are not included in
 the specification.
 Due to their scope of application, one cannot parse out the impact of individua
l components of said effects.
 In general, it is preferable to model the specific phenomenon directly
 when possible (in this case, neighborhood effects).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, as Anselin and Arribas-Bel note, the spatial fixed effect approach
 only mitigates spatial dependence in certain situations.

 In particular, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

unless there are strong theoretical or practical reasons why distance decay
 should be ruled out, the use of spatial fixed effects will not be sufficient
 to correct for the presence of spatial correlation.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Admittedly, there is only limited use of weight matrices that exhibit kernel
 decay in this study, but we do expect that distance will erode the effect
 on a given county.
 Consequently, the choice to model spatial dependency will better align
 with future extensions of this work.

\begin_layout Description
Tapering captures the notion that services are generally delivered from
 a particular location.
 The farther one gets from this location, the smaller the benefit one may
 experience from a service emanating from said location.
 An easy example of this phenomenon is the provision of local fire fighting
 services.
 The farther one resides from the fire station, the longer it takes to consume
 the service in the event of a fire.
 This lag is likely to lead to larger amounts of damage if a fire is occurring.
 Thus, the expected benefit for residents who live 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

far
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the station is lower than those that live 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

near
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the station.
 This effect has implications for the definition of a pure public good.
 Tapering inhibits the ability to provide a service uniformly.
 Even if resources were such that all fire calls at any given time could
 be accommodated, a form of rivalry has creeped into the picture.
 Stochastic consumption of fire services is more heavily consumed as a function
 of spatial proximity.

 We must, however, acknowledge that resource disparities do exist and jurisdicti
onal boundaries neatly capture the joint distribution of resources, service
 costs, and service delivery.
 The more important element is an extension of this differentiation.
 An optimal jurisdictional area would efficiently capture the tax-expenditure
 bundle preferred by the constituents, and the optimal size for a jurisdiction
 is that which accords with the optimal range for delivery of the services
 rendered.
 To continue the fire services example, at some distance

 from the station, the cost of transporting fire fighting resources outweighs

 the marginal benefit of service delivery and the marginal cost of fire
 damage are equivalent.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
The economic potential of any system is not only driven by the presence
 of natual and/or developed capital, but also the institutions that govern
 the exploitation of these valueable assets.
 In this sense, the term economic potential is misleadingly incomplete.
 The mechanism that drives resource allocation is a function of both the
 distribution of purely economic value and the feasible range of activities
 governed by political institutions.
 The goal of institutional design for economic growth, therefore, ought
 to be the facilitation of those activities that increase the marginal product
 of

 efforts.
 If the objective is the maximization of economic growth, this broad goal
 is unlikely to draw many detractors.
 The devil, however, is in the details.
 The major challenge for any fiscal manager is operating under institutional
 constructs that reflect in one way or another the will of the constituents,
 while also achieving the expected fiscal outcomes.
 This task is challenging because these concepts are not separable.

Once the fiscal policy objectives or targets are decided upon government
 tries to implement them by using policy parameters, such as tax rates,
 subsidies, transfers, purchases and other types of government expenditures
 over which it has conrol.
 These parameters are known as instruments.
 Policy targets and instruments belong to the same economic system.
 The former are endogenous and the latter are pre-determined.
 The values policy targets take depend on the type of instruments employed,
 and the relation between them will be determined by the structure of the
 economy.

As used here, revenue yield signifies the actual, realized revenue collected
 by a given jurisdiction.
 Revenue capacity, by contrast, captures the economic potential of the tax
 base.
 We may think of this concept as the abstract revenue yield for a given
 county at some standard level of tax effort.
 If, for example, the property in county A is more expensive than the property
 in county B, county A can collect more revenue than county B with the same
 level of tax effort.
 In this example, county A has greater revenue capacity than county B.

For starters, from a Tiebout perspective, local revenue instruments are
 important because they act as prices for local constituents.
 They are the costs incurred by taxpayers in exchange for the consumption
 of local public services.
 Costs lead consumers to perform triage.
 Without costs, the strong monotonicity assumption is permitted to run wild.
 In other words, constituents would seek to consume without limit.
 It is the provision of local revenue by taxpayers that reveals opportunity
 cost and forces them to reveal their preferences.
 In so doing, they provide the information required by local fiscal managers
 to make smart choices in service of satisfying voter preferences.

Weak monotonicity says that 'at least as much of everything is at least
 as good'.
 If the consumer can costlessly dispose of unwanted goods, this assumption
 is trivial.
 Strong monotonicity says that at least as much of every good, and strictly
 more of some good, is better.
 This is simply assuming that goods are good.

As discussed in Subsection

, local discretion over revenue sources is critical for local autonomy,
 an ideal that has been advocated on practical and theoretical grounds.
 Practical arguments extend back at least as far the debate over the crafting
 of the US Constitution.
 The so-called Anti-Federalists argued vociferously against the consolidation
 of power in central government.
 They believed that not only was this a sure path to a tyrannical regime,
 but also that it was remarkably impractical to try and govern so vast and
 diverse a country from a single location.
 Representatives sent to higher levels of government could not possibly
 reflect the rich diversity of interests and needs that would inevitably
 fall within their purview.
 From a theoretical perspective, local autonomy facilitates the pursuit
 of the marginal equivalence of costs and benefits, an efficiency enhancing
 feature that naturally seeks welfare maximization for society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Detractors could feasibly argue that marginal equivalence is not actually
 possible because the costs of production are often uncoupled with the means
 of financing public goods.
 Furthermore, given disparities in resource endowments, there are limits
 to the volume and quality of services that can be provided for some local
 jurisdictions, no matter what their preferences are.
 For the sake of balance, we should also note that the Federalists were
 greatly concerned by the potential for material harm to minority 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

factions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if local autonomy was too strong.
 Their bias towards central provision was cultivated in part because they
 believed the multitude of opinions expressed at higher levels of government
 would lead to fairer outcomes, in this case fairer allocations of public
 resources.
 In the end, all that seems to be clear is that either extreme appears to
 be undesirable.
 Therefore, the role for local own-source revenue is an important one that
 is worthy of study.

What is the Expected Impact of TELs on Fiscal Convergence?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fiscal convergence in our context carries a spatial dimension.
 When one considers the siting choice of a taxpayer, theoretically, the
 entire set of local jurisdictions in the country is available to him or
 her.
 In reality, however, the costs associated with all of these choices is
 far from equal even when staying inside Colorado.
 Leaving aside cost of living for the purposes of our analysis, the costs
 of mobilization are non-trivial.
 It is much more costly for a resident of the northeastern County of Logan
 to move to the southwestern County of Montezuma, than it would be to move
 to the neighboring County of Morgan.
 Thus, convergence in fiscal outcomes does not have to be uniform across
 the entire state to have a significant impact.
 The activity that occurs in the local neighborhood, the collection of counties
 that are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the county of interest, is the driving factor.
 For this reason, we are concerned with the
\emph on
 clustering of fiscal behavior within the local neighborhood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a theoretical standpoint, there are two main features of COTELs that
 would promote fiscal clustering among low-capacity jurisdictions in particular.
 First, COTELs impose asymmetric pressure on revenue yields over time.
 The rate of increase is limited by an explicit growth limit, but decreasing
 yields are not so constrained.
 Furthermore, once a drop in revenue has been experienced in one year, the
 baseline is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ratcheted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 down.
 The allowable revenue in the current year is measured against only the
 previous year's revenue, and not the long term trend.
 Low revenue years have a disproportionate impact on the long-term revenue
 capacity of the jurisdiction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second impact is related to the first.
 To the extent that COTELs bias revenue downward (in a manner quite uncoupled
 with demand projections), it becomes increasingly difficult for constrained
 jurisdictions to invest in the human and physical capital needed to support
 robust economic growth.
 The first effect impacts revenue generation, while the second impacts the
 capacity of the economic base itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A complicating factor is the existence of spillovers.
 Both the provision of public goods and the economic vitality of neighboring
 jurisdictions impact the fiscal and economic capacity of the primary jurisdicti
on.
 This externality network has the potential to dynamically reinforce economic
 growth behavior, whether it be a high or low growth regime.
 If COTELs exacerbate this effect, there could be undesirable long-term
 consequences for low capacity counties seeking to create the conditions
 for economic growth.
 Insofar as the relationship between COTEL intensity and spatial dependency
 is evaluated, this chapter explores this phenomenon directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
How is Fiscal Clustering Measured?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Testing whether or not the constraints imposed by COTELs lead to fiscal
 convergence is difficult to achieve with the prevailing models in this
 area.
 Most of the empirical work attempts to study TELs across states, and as
 such, focuses on statewide definitions of TELs.
 This tends to cover up local variation, but perhaps more interestingly,
 this choice in geographic scope encourages certain kinds of questions.
 What is the impact of TELs on revenue volatility?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparatively little research examines the within state dynamic.
 Once one asks the question about local differences, modeling the parameter
 of interest is a different game altogether.
 In this case, the researcher must tease out variation among fiscal circumstance
s for which statewide policy is a common denominator.
 Once this issue comes to the fore, one is immediately confronted with the
 following question: if the statewide policy does not vary cross-sectionally,
 do we expect uniform impact across all jurisdictions at time 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$t$
\end_layout

\end_inset

? Fiscal behavior is a function of economic circumstance, and given the
 variation in economic bases across a given state, one would expect COTELs
 to have different impacts in different jurisdictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second, and related, question is whether or not we expect a temporal element
 in the impact of COTELs.
 Does the constraint placed on a county increase with the amount of time
 the county has spent operating under the COTEL? Furthermore, given the
 fact that the COTEL environment is composed of overlapping policies, do
 we expect interaction effects to play a role? To shed light on such questions,
 this study employs spatial techniques to examine a panel dataset of county-leve
l fiscal and economic data in Colorado over the 1987-2009 time period (econometr
ic exploration begins in 1995).
 First, we establish the existence of temporal variation in fiscal clustering,
 and then we employ econometric techniques to uncover the impact of COTEL
 intensity and the Gallagher Ratio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Does Fiscal Clustering Occur and Does it Change Over Time?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hypothesis rests on the idea that not only does spatial clustering of
 fiscal behavior occur, the nature of the clustering must vary over time.
 Without both of these conditions, there is no basis for measuring the impact
 of COTELs on fiscal convergence.
 To determine whether or not these conditions are met, we will take snapshots
 of fiscal and economic hotspots
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Hotspots
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are pockets of similar values.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 every five years, starting with 1987.
 Fiscal hotspots are evaluated via measurement of revenue yield per capita.
 Economic hotspots are evaluated via annual payroll per capita.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One might reasonably ask why annual payroll is being used.
 It does not correspond to a specific tax base levied by Colorado counties,
 and in general, per capita income is usually the preferred measure.
 There are three reasons for this choice.
 First, a measure of the tax base is already established with per capita
 revenue.
 We seek to get at the total economic resources available in this case.
 Second, in comparing income and annual payroll, we see that income is tied
 to residents that live in the jurisdiction while payroll is tied to firms
 that are located in the jurisdiction.
 Since residents can earn income in jurisdictions other than the one in
 which they live, their income is more likely to reflect decisions made
 outside of the county.
 Annual payroll, on the other hand, is necessarily contained within the
 county.
 This is useful insofar as it directly speaks to the economic activity influence
d by the decisions of policymakers within the county.
 Third, annual payroll is readily available by county throughout the study
 period, thanks to the rather detailed Quarterly Census of Employment and
 Wages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hotspots are identified with Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation
 (LISAs) developed initially by Getis & Ord

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 The measures are Getis & Ord's G* (GOG) and Local Moran's I (LMI), respectively.
 To evaluate clustering, LISAs require a definition of the linkages of importanc
e between jurisdictions.
 Said differently, they require an explicitly defined local neighborhood.
 Spatial analysis is generally sensitive to the choice of weight matrices
 (which define the local neighborhood), so we test multiple neighborhood
 criteria.
 Corroboration across tests lends support to the findings.

Weight matrices, in an abstract sense, define 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

closeness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The definition of proximity can vary quite dramatically by application.
 The most natural interpretation, the one employed in this study, is based
 upon spatial proximity.
 However, it is quite plausible to use other distance measures.
 For example, one might define neighbors as those counties with similar
 demographics, industrial bases, or any other characteristic of interest.
 Since the focus of this study is on siting choice given the cost of mobility,
 spatial proximity is a natural choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking spatial proximity as the weight basis, there are a number of ways
 to define the neighborhood.
 This study employs two common approaches: contiguity and distance.
 As one might expect, contiguity requires contact to be considered a neighbor.
 Contact with the primary jurisdiction is not strictly required.
 A second order contiguous neighborhood, for example, would include neighbors
 that contacted a jurisdiction in contact with the primary jurisdiction.
 Distance, by contrast, includes as neighbors all jurisdictions within some
 distance of the primary jurisdiction.

Within the contiguity and distance classes of weight matrices, there are
 several variations on the theme.
 Figure

 shows two types of contiguous neighborhood definitions in the first two
 panels: rook and queen.
 As can be seen, these definitions are taken directly from the rules of
 chess.
 The third panel provides a generic view of a neighborhood defined via a
 distance metric.
 In this instance, distance is measured from the primary jurisdictions centroid,
 but one could envision distance from the closest border or the population's
 center of gravity being relevant metrics as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As depicted in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, all of the weights for each neighborhood are binary.
 Blue squares indicate weight values of 1, so those jurisdictions are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Binary classification of neighbors is in no way a requirement.

 of decay functions in common use.
 This study employs three kinds: binary, inverse distance, and Gaussian.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two primary measures used to establish spatial clustering for
 each weigh matrix/year combination.
 LMI measures the global spatial autocorrelation in an attribute

\end_inset

 over a given neighborhood.
 Equation

\end_inset

 is calculated for each county, 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

.
 LMI permits a kind of topological view of autocorrelation.
 Just as providing a single moment of a vector of values masks other distributio
nal characteristics of the data, providing only a single global parameter
 for spatial association masks regional dynamics.
 LMI reveals these dynamics by providing values for each spatial observation
 (e.g.
 county), thereby enabling the analyst to take note of patterns (e.g.
 fiscal clusters).
 LMI returns high values for a county when it is surrounded by
\emph on

 values, and it returns low values when it is surrounded by
\emph on

 In both collections, the first plot matrix displays clustering of revenue
 yield (per capita revenue) and revenue capacity (per capita annual payroll).
 While the intensity of clustering does vary to some extent across different

Not only does revenue yield clustering occur, the extent of the clustering
 changes over time.
 Furthermore, upon closer examination of the data, three main properties
 stand out:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Variation is substantially higher in GOG, which indicates relative consistency
 in clustering activity, with larger variation in the magnitude of clustering
 values.
 This could mean correlated revenue capacity shifts across multiple counties
 within given neighborhoods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Variation is generally more substantial in the higher values for both statistics.
 For LMI, this indicates varying intensity of spatial association amongst
 similar values.
 For GOG, this indicates low capacity counties are more tightly coupled
 than high capacity counties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Central tendency generally leans right of zero for LMI, and left of zero
 for GOG.
 This suggests a tendency towards the existence of spatial clustering, but
 this clustering occurs more often among low capacity jurisdictions.

Do TELs Depress Revenue Yield and Capacity?

Globally consistent trends in clustering are far from clear in the figures
 above, but it is clear that there exists variation in the intensity of
 clustering as time passes.
 Extracting the marginal effect of COTEL intensity requires econometric
 exploration.
 In this analysis, we employ three approaches to explore this impact on
 measures of both revenue yield (per capita revenue;

Squares estimation serves as the baseline specification.
 It is primarily an exploratory modeling exercise to place the integration
 of spatial and temporal dependency in context.
 Two models, with per capita revenue and per capita annual payroll, the
 primary dependents, are evaluated.
 Furthermore, given the absence of an explicitly modeled spatial dependency
 structure, the pooled OLS approach facilitates the exploration of COTEL
 intensity impact on the LISAs defined above.
 The LISA subset of models use each combination of LISA measure, fiscal
 indicator, and weight matrix as the dependent variable.
 For example, one dependent (
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$w
\backslash

\backslash
_i$
\end_layout

\end_inset

) will be the LMI score for per capita revenue, as calculated with rook
 contiguity.
 Dependents capturing annual payroll include an extension:

 There are two LISAs (LMI and GOG), two fiscal indicators (per capita revenue

).
 Therefore, there are 20 LISA models.

Lag estimation provides year-specific assessments of COTEL intensity impact

 The decision to select one weight matrix for presentation is a function
 of two factors.
 First, the trends revealed by the analysis are generally insensitive to
 the choice of weight matrix.
 Second, presentation of all weight matrices is likely to suffer from diminishin
g returns while simultaneously inhibiting the central message.
 In general, this series of models provides some sense of temporal variation
 over time.
 There are two fiscal indicators (per capita revenue and per capita annual
 payroll) and 17 years (1993-2009), leading to a total of 34 models.

Panel estimation does not contain a spatial component, but it does enable
 us to incorporate county-level unobservable characteristics (albeit suboptimall
y).
 This basically trades one specification element, spatial autoregression,
 for another, capture of county-specific factors that do not explicitly
 enter the model.
 The approach provides a cleaner view of TEL impacts than cross-sectional
 analysis because the fixed effects shift the focus to within county deviations.
 Two of these models are run, one for each dependent:

 One would be well within the bounds of reasonableness to ask why an analyst

 When estimating the parameters of an economic process, the precise nature

\begin_layout Standard
We may think of the autonomous relations as those which bind the components
 of the true, underlying data generating process.
 We know that, for example, the volume of a gas is proportional to its temperatu
re, which is just a measure of the kinetic energy in the gas.
 This is a natural linkage, in the sense that it is always true, everywhere.
 This is an autonomous relation.
 When we seek to measure such a phenomenon, however, one must worry about
 confluent relations.
 For example, we will not observe the natural linkage between temperature
 and volume if the volume is somehow constrained by another variable in
 the system.
 This would produce variation in our estimates, even if no such variation
 exists in the underlying data generating process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we have no validation mechanism that reveals the data generating process
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If we did, of what value would estimation be?
\end_layout

\end_inset

, we cannot know if we are actually observing an autonomous or confluent
 relation.
 Consequently, Hoover suggests that we must assume all of our observations
 are confluent interactions between the more conceptually atomistic autonomous
 relations.
 The question remains, what is the appropriate mitigation strategy?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First and foremost, we must recognize that each econometric strategy we
 may employ has its failings.
 For example, fixed effect estimation is useful for capturing the aggregate
 impact of group-specific characteristics, but by failing to identify the
 characteristics covered by the fixed effect explicitly it creates challenges
 in exploring the specific nature of these impacts.
 Just as a sample drawn from a population provides a specific view of the
 population that does not capture its full variety, the model an analyst
 chooses to employ captures a particular view of that sample.
 That view is a function of both the strengths and weaknesses of the modeling
 approach and the specification evaluated by the analyst.

 A graphical approach is taken here.
 Furthermore, a summary view of the LISA models is provided, each view of

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Baseline Estimation with Pooled Ordinary Least Squares
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As will become apparent, the pooled OLS models provide a view of a counterintuit
ive, yet relatively consistent, narrative.
 While the COTEL intensity measure (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$intensity
\backslash
_stock$
\end_layout

\end_inset

) has the expected negative and statistically significant effect on revenue
 yield (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$pcrev$
\end_layout

\end_inset

), higher values of the intensity measure are consistently associated with
 higher levels of fiscal capacity (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$pcap$
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 This is a curious result that directly challenges the notion that COTELs
 limit the fiscal capacity of a given county.
 Furthermore, the same revenue yield relationship holds for the ratio of
 residential and non-residential property (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$prop
\backslash
_ratio$
\end_layout

\end_inset

) used to capture the impact of the Gallagher Amendment (the Gallagher Ratio).
 Again, higher relative amounts of residential property are associated with
 lower revenue yields.
 This accords with intuition to the extent that GA is designed to limit
 residential property tax liability.
 Fiscal capacity, on the other hand, is higher in counties which have higher
 relative levels of residential property in the assessment base.

Note also the large disparity in model fit across the two models.
 This is a persistent character of this analysis - all of the revenue yield
 models explain a larger portion of the variance than do their fiscal capacity
 counterparts.
 This is perhaps unsurprising.
 The impact of institutions and economic changes on revenue yield is much
 more direct than is the impact on fiscal capacity.
 Complete identification of this indirect linkage can be pursued in future
 research.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Evaluating the Impact on Fiscal Clustering with Local Indicators of Spatial
 Autocorrelation (LISAs)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the LISAs as dependents provides some notion of how the variables
 in the model impact spatial clustering of revenue yield and fiscal capacity.
 Counties experiencing higher levels of COTEL intensity are expected to
 converge in the revenue yield and fiscal capacity measures.
 In effect, the COTELs are expected to retard their revenue growth, which
 will create a wedge between constrained and unconstrained counties.
 It has already been shown that spatial clustering of fiscal behavior occurs,
 so this wedge is expected to be spatially relevant.
 The visualization of these results employs averages across the five weight
 matrices used in this analysis (see Subsecton 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 Again, this is to limit the sensitivity of interpretation to choice of

To reiterate, high values of LMI indicate the clustering of similar values,
 while low values indicate the clustering of disimilar values.
 In other words, high values of LMI can indicate the presence of a local
 neighborhood of counties characterized by either high revenue yield/fiscal
 capacity or low revenue yield/fiscal capacity.
 In contrast, high values of GOG indicate clustering of high values, while
 low values of GOG indicate clustering of low values.
 Thus, LMI reveals more about the strength of clustering while GOG reveals
 more about the type of clustering.

When controlling for other factors, COTEL intensity (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$intensity
\backslash
_stock$
\end_layout

\end_inset

) has very limited impact on the clustering of revenue yield (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$pcrev$
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Said differently, if a county is highly constrained, the constraint is
 not a significant driver of the clustering that already exists.
 This is interesting because one could reasonably expect that the inflexibility
 of achievable expenditures in the constrained county would force convergence
 in fiscal behavior, thereby taking jurisdictional idiosyncrasies out of
 the siting equation and reinforcing similar revenue preferences in the
 local neighborhood.
 It is possible that collaborative efforts in the local neighborhood to
 provide wide area services free up enough revenue to still allow for some
 base level of distinction.
 Further, COTEL intensity has a rather ambivalent relationship with fiscal
 capacity (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$pcap$
\end_layout

\end_inset

) clustering values (GOG), which speaks little to the idea that higher levels
 of COTEL constraints are related to clustering of low values of fiscal
 capacity.
 In other words, this view provides no support for the hypothesis that COTELs
 ultimately limit fiscal capacity for low-income jurisdictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the Gallagher Ratio (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$prop
\backslash
_ratio$
\end_layout

\end_inset

) behaves precisely as we would expect from a revenue yield perspective.
 Insofar as it increases the strength of clustering (higher values of LMI)
 and decreases the values assoicated with said clustering (low values of
 GOG), the evidence suggests that the measure is a limiting factor on revenue
 yield in the local neighborhood.
 On the fiscal capacity side, the Gallagher Ratio is neither statistically
 or substantively relevant.
 In both the revenue yield and fiscal capacity models, the model fit is
 modest at best (particularly with respect to the latter) and categorically
 lower than the fit of any other model considered in this chapter.

Incorporating the Local Neighborhood with Spatial Lags
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Repeated SLM analysis allows us to incorporate the local neighborhood explicitly
 because the spatial lag of the dependent variable is the weighted average
 of the dependent variable value in the neighboring jurisdictions.
 Evaluating annual cross-sections is useful insofar as it provides a view
 of the variation in regressor impact over time, both in magnitude and significa
nce.
 The non-trivial downsides are two-fold:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Repeated cross-sections do not permit control of year-specific factors;
 and,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To the extent that deBrucing is an ongoing phenomenon, there is temporal
 variance in the sample properties.
 The characteristics of the counties, namely the capacity of COTELs to constrain
 a given jurisdiction, are changing over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence, the technique can only be useful in this context as a
 complementary component in a larger analysis.

With respect to revenue yield, both COTEL intensity (

) and the Gallagher Ratio (
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

) accord with the pooled OLS results.
 They both materially decrease the revenue per capita in the county, even
 after controlling for the revenue dynamics in the local neighborhood.
 In other words, these are reductions over and above the preferences that
 may be shared with neighboring jurisdictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interesting dynamic revealed by the repeated cross-sectional approach
 is that COTEL intensity appears to get less significant over time, both
 in statistical and substantive terms.
 In contrast, the Gallagher Ratio is doing precisely the opposite.
 This could indicate either a shift in the composition of counties subject
 to binding COTEL constraints or a shift in the composition of the property
 assessment base (or both).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Evaluating fiscal capacity with the repeated SLM approach reveals the tenuous
 nature of any direct connection between our COTEL variables and per capita
 annual payroll.
 COTEL intensity and the Gallagher Ratio are both statististically insignificant
 in every single year.
 For the most part, COTEL intensity is also substantively insignificant
 while the Gallagher Ratio demonstrates substantial variation in magnitude.
 With respect to the latter, it is also worth noting that the sign of the
 Gallagher Ratio estimate remains at least directionally consistent with
 the pooled OLS run.
 Even when controlling for the other factors, the underlying positive relationsh

Capturing Temporal Dependency with Fixed Effects

Pivoting from the modeling of spatial to temporal dependency, it is possible
 to control for county-specific unobservables that may obscure the mechanism
 by which changes in COTEL intensity (

) and the Gallagher Ratio (

 The panel model results plot for revenue yield reveals a consistent theme
 for most variables, although the permitting rate (

 Both COTEL intensity and the Gallagher Ratio are modestly depressing forces
 on revenue yield in a given county.

 If the estimates are standardized to reflect the impact sizes as a multiple
 of the standard deviation, a one standard deviation shift in COTEL intensity
 accounts for a shift in revenue yield of approximately 4% of one standard
 deviation in revenue yield (

 The parallel impact for the Gallagher Ratio is 9%.

\begin_layout Standard
The results of the panel analysis of fiscal capacity do little to sort out
 a pattern in the estimates reported in previous models.
 While COTEL intensity is still positive and significant once again, the
 Gallagher Ratio is now negative for fiscal capacity.
 The latter result contrasts sharply with the pooled OLS and SLM models.
 This may suggest that the other models were using the Gallagher Ratio as
 a proxy for some of the unobserved characteristics we are now capturing
 in the fixed effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Summary of Findings and Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This analysis was designed to evaluate the impact of the cumulative, composite
 limit imposed by TABOR and the Statewide Limit on Property Tax Revenue
 (a.k.a.
 COTEL intensity), as well as the Gallagher Amendment, on two fiscal indicators:
 revenue yield (revenue per capita) and fiscal capacity (annual payroll
 per capita).
 To pursue this objective, the analysis employed pooled OLS, spatial lag
 models, and panel analysis to identify patterns in the COTEL impacts from
 a variety of perspectives.
 While there was non-trivial variation in the magnitude of impact, COTELs
 consistently depressed revenue yields.
 This accords with intuition, and empirical exploration has borne this out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In constrast, the fiscal capacity models consistently explained less variation
 relative to revenue yield models, and the impacts of COTELs were inconclusive
 across models.
 The implication is that COTELs do not have direct impacts on fiscal capacity.
 Rather, the ultimate impact is likely a function of how individual counties
 respond to the constraints placed on them by statewide COTEL policies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should also be noted that the analysis in this paper makes clear that
 differential impacts across counties are non-trivial.
 These disparities in the impacts of COTELs are drive by dynamic economic
 characteristics of each county.
 Furthermore, the economic circumstances of counties display spatial dependency,
 and spatial clustering occurs more strongly among low revenue/capacity
 counties.
 Consequently, policies that depress revenue yield or fiscal capacity exacerbate
 this phenomenon.
 With respect to revenue yield, it is clear that COTELs do just that.
 The impact of COTELs on fiscal capacity, however, warrants greater study.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:RevYieldCapacity"

\end_inset

, the impact of COTELs on the revenue side of county finance in Colorado
 was explored.
 This chapter focuses on the other side of the equation: expenditure behavior.
 This shift in focus is designed to structurally capture the duality of
 public finance discussed in Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Duality-in-Public-Finance"

\end_inset

.
 While popular discourse tends to decouple the two, revenues and expenditures
 are instrinsically linked.
 Each unit of revenue collected by a government not used to cover the cost
 of labor is redeployed as some programmatic output designed to either increase
 the real income of constituents or increase their capacity to generate
 income elsewhere.
 Even though the topic of revenue could have consumed the entirety of this
 dissertation, recognition of fiscal duality demands some level of balance
 in topic selection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whereas Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:RevYieldCapacity"

\end_inset

 was concerned with the general capacity of a county to finance public services,
 this chapter begins to explore the specific expenditure choices made in
 the context of COTELs and fiscal clustering.
 In particular, it seeks to understand whether or not counties that face
 constraints under the TEL regime in Colorado make different choices about
 how to spend public funds than they otherwise would.
 Indeed, since we do not observe an alternative state of the world, such
 a question raises certain difficulties.
 The chief obstacle is the establishment of an artifical, yet defensible,
 counterfactual scenario.
 The analysis that follows leans on basic tools of machine learning to construct
 such a scenario.
 In so doing, this chapter serves two purposes.
 First and foremost, it sheds light on the expenditure side impact of COTELs.
 Second, it suggests that students of public finance can learn from the
 methods of others, which sometimes have favorable characteristics that
 help to mitigate deficiencies in more conventional methods.
 In general, we should seek to employ complementary (but not redundant)
 tools whenever possible, even if they are unconventional from the field's
 perspective.
 As discussed in Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Econometrics-as-Observation"

\end_inset

, consistent results from a variety of calculations lends credibility to
 the analysis.

Why does a Shift in Expenditure Patterns Matter?

\begin_layout Standard
In
\emph on
 The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure
\emph default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Samuelson1954"

\end_inset

, Paul Sameulson evaluated the implications of the joint consumption of
 public goods.
 This feature of public goods separates them from private goods along one
 very important dimension: the feasibility of preference revelation.
 Without the ability to determine what an individual would pay for the marginal
 unit of public good 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

, there is no natural way to determine the efficient volume of 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 that should be supplied to society.
 Tiebout, on the other hand, argued that a critical variable had been omitted
 from the analysis: mobility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The consumer-voter may be viewed as picking that community which best satisfies
 his preference pattern for public goods.
 [...] The greater the number of communities and the greater the variance among
 them, the closer the consumer will come to fully realizing his preference
 position.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Tiebout1956"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In effect, Tiebout was suggesting that the Samuelson model only applies
 when only one supplier exists.
 However, if many suppliers exist, the consumer-voter is able to choose
 from among the set.
 This choice provides the avenue for revealed preference.
 That is, we can make claims about what consumers prefer based upon what
 they choose to consume.
 A mechanism similar to that at work in the private sector could therefore
 be applied to public spaces when mulitiple providers are present.
 It is clear that returns to scale and consistency make the multi-provider
 framework undesirable at the national level.
 In a federal system, however, multiple providers must exist in the subnational
 space, particularly at the local level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To further the implication of Tiebout's insight, there are two dimensions
 along which the consumption evironment may provide the capacity for revealed
 preference.
 First, the ease with which preferences may be articulated increases with
 the volume of choices, or in this case, the number of local governments
 in the choice set.
 For our purposes, this number is basically fixed.
 While jurisdictions do come and go, over the study period (1993-2009) the
 movement is negligible.
 Second, for true options to exist, there must be differentiation across
 the available products.
 If one seeks something to eat and the choice is between an apple and ...
 an identical apple, no true choice exists.
 If a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

consumer-voter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is to reveal his/her preference, there must be some distinction between
 community characteristics that can elicit different return values from
 his/her utility function.
 While it must be made clear that this chapter in no way seeks to evaluate
 mobility, this idea of differentiation is critical to this analysis.
 The motivational hypothesis behind it is the idea that differentiation
 across communities is non-trivially impacted by the imposition of COTELs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This analysis seeks to complement the study of TEL impact on expenditure
 behavior conducted by Daniel Mullins.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mullins2004"

\end_inset

 He finds that TELs do not uniformly constrain the finances of all affected
 jurisdictions.
 Rather, governments serving less affluent communities are most adversely
 impacted by the limitation.
 A looming question is, what is the role of spatial externalities emanating
 from the local neighborhood? Spillovers can and do impact fiscal behavior
 at the local level.
 The question explored here is whether or not the variation in constraint
 observed in Mullins (2004) remains when spillovers are taken into account.
 That being said, the aim here is slightly different.
 To reiterate, we want to compare each county to a simulated version of
 itself to explore the impact of COTELs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
How are Shifts in Expenditure Patterns Measured?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To fulfill the research objective, there are two major questions that must
 be answered:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How can one tell if a county has deflected from its preferred expenditure
 portfolio?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How can one measure how much it has deflected?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the past, there have been three broad approaches taken to address such
 problems.
 First, the use of broad classifications have provided summary views of
 shifts in behavior.
 For example, on the revenue side, one may split revenues into two groups:
 tax and non-tax.
 The revenues can then be characterized by a single proportional value and
 entered easily into a given model.
 This is a useful approach, but there is a threat that disimilar cases will
 be lumped together.
 If we have limited resolution (only two dimensions of comparison in the
 example), there is a limited ability to typify communities into distinct
 groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second approach has been to highlight changes in a single function (e.g.
 changes in infrastructure expenditure), which improves on the resolution
 deficiency of the first approach.
 However, the number of comparisons required to fully specify a jurisdiction
 across all functions and compare it with other jurisdictions quickly grows
 unmanageable.
 The primary reason is that, in a set of 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$n$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 jurisdictions, each function of a given jurisdiction 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$n_i$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 must be compared with the corresponding function of the other 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$n-1$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 jurisdictions.
 One approach to this problem has been to limit comparisons to an earlier
 version of the same jurisdiction, but this within-county scope strays from
 our concern regarding differentiation across jurisdictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A third approach is a regression decomposition framework, whereby the proportion
al contribution of each function is represented as a regressor in the model.
 This method is quite useful for uncovering the average effects of revenue
 or expenditure composition on other variables of interest, but movement
 in the expenditure profile is what we are pursuing in this case.
 This movement must be the dependent variable, and we seek a measure that
 tells us about the movement at the individual county level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach taken here is typification.
 In the absence of a counterfactual, we can instead ask how counties of
 a similar type respond to differing levels of COTEL constraint.
 In effect, we are asking whether or not jurisdictions with similar expenditure
 preferences at the outset still have similar behavior after COTELs have
 been imposed.
 If similar expenditure preferences persist, the interpretation is that
 COTELs have not led to a change in the expenditure preferences of the county
 in question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Is It Reasonable to Construct Counterfactuals through Typification?
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Typification-Reasonable"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implicit assumption that comes with the typification approach is that
 the same counties that share common preferences at time 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$t$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 will still share preferences at time 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$t+l$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$l>0$
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Stated differently, the assumption is one of constant covariance in preferences
 across counties, over time.
 This is certainly not a trivial assumption.
 The relevant question is, what are the available alternatives?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One could compare each county at time 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$t$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 with itself at time 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$t+l$
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This approach would have the virtue of avoiding the assumption of constant
 covariance in preferences.
 However, it does assume that preferences
\emph on
 within a county
\emph default
 do not change at all.
 Thus, the question becomes, which assumption is more offensive, constant
 covariance or static preferences? To the extent that we know the macro-envirome
nt is changing over time in Colorado, characterized at the very least by
 significant increases in income and population, constant preferences seems
 to fail the face validity test.
 Furthermore, as we learned in Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:RevYieldCapacity"

\end_inset

, while fiscal clustering changed in intensity over time, the broad patterns
 were fairly persistent.
 This observation lends at least some support for the idea that the constant
 covariance assumption does have some degree of merit.
 It should also be reiterated here that we are concerned also with differences
 across counties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One could capture the evolution of preferences by comparing counties in
 Colorado with counties in other states that do not operate in the COTEL
 context.
 This capture, though, is just a repackaging of the constant covariance
 assumption.
 The comparison in this case is just a single county instead of a county
 type, which generally seems to be a riskier bet.
 The maximum gap between two members of a population will generally be larger
 than the maximum gap between a single member and some measure of the population
's central tendency.
 To vary on this theme, given a population, the
\emph on
 expected
\emph default
 gap between member 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$i$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and any member 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset ERT

\emph on
 is the gap between member 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$i$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and the population's measure of central tendency.

\emph default
 In a nutshell, the variance in the quality of the cross-state match over
 time seems to be generally wider than that which would be experienced via
 the within-state typification approach.
 This is not to mention that the cross-state match strategy would still
 have to clear the hurdle of accommodating state-specific unobservables,
 a hurdle that one need not grapple with when using the within-state typificatio
n approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interval nature of the COTEL variables used in this study afford within-stat
e matching, which would avoid the state-specific unobservable problem.
 Such an approach, however, would not escape the single county variance
 problem.
 In general, measures of central tendency are more stable than individual
 elements in a population, and thus are better suited to serve as reference
 points.
 In general, while constant covariance is a strong assumption, it does not
 appear that other approaches avoid potentially more damaging assumptions.

The challenge that arises when comparing jurisdictions to one another is
 how one may uncover a simple comparison while still incorporating all of
 the complexity of the entire expenditure function vector.
 To achieve this, some form of dimensionality reduction is required, as
 is some method of understanding which jurisdictions are similar and which
 ones are not.
 The approach taken here is to place the counties in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and evaluate the distances between them.
 Space, in this context, is the coordinate position in the

The figure demonstrates the concept of fiscal position in two dimensions.
 Suppose Counties A, B, and C all had only two expenditure functions: Infrastuct
ure and Public Safety.
 We can relate their expenditure profiles to one another by placing the
 counties in space according to the proportion of expenditures allocated
 to each function.
 In the figure, County A is more similar to County B in expenditure preferences
 than County C.
 This concept is scaleable to, if not depictable in, an aribitrary number
 of dimensions.

 In this framework, deflection of a given county from the group's preferences
 will be identified by an increase in the distance between the county's
 fiscal position and the central tendency in the group's set of fiscal positions.
 To perform this task, two questions must be answered:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How is the space defined?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How are clusters identified?

To define the space in which fiscal positions were mapped, there were actually
 two parallel tracks taken in the analysis.
 One track proceeded as described above, in the 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

-dimensional space defined by the full number of expenditure functions compared.
 While this approach facilitates interpretation of any single dimension,
 the high number of dimensions is 1) difficult to contemplate all at once,
 2) impossible to visualize, and 3) vulnerable to sparsity in broad swaths
 of the expenditure space.

Recall that estimation generally attempts to get at some form of local averaging.
 To be efficient, that is, to minimize the variance in the estimate, it
 requires that a number of observations are close to the location being
 evaluated.
 There are only 64 counties evaluated in any given year.
 If they all varied in the dependent value and in only one independent dimension
, we would likely be able to estimate with a high degree of precision.
 As soon as a second independent dimension is added, however, the area in
 which observations may reside increases dramatically.
 It becomes much less likely that observations are close enough together
 to provide the estimating precision experienced with only one independent
 dimension.
 This potential observation space increases yet again with a third dimension,
 and further still with a fourth.
 In general, each new dimension one adds to the model requires a substantial
 increase in the number of observations needed to maintain the same estimating
 precision.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One approach that mitigates these concerns is the dimension-reduction technique
 known as principal component analysis (PCA).
 This method enables one to leverage linear combinations of the original
 dimension set.
 It is used here to place counties in three dimensional space, albeit at
 a cost of a reduction in interpretability for each of the resulting dimensions.
 In other words, moving along a given dimension in the principal component
 space (e.g.
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$x_1=5d_1 + 3d_2 + 4d_3$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$d_*$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 could represent public safety) is much more difficult to characterize than
 moving along a given dimension in the original 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$n$
\end_layout

\end_inset

-dimensional space (e.g.
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$x_1=d_1$
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 To the extent that our main concern is the magnitude of the distance between
 a county and its start group, we can still pull useful information out
 of this approach, even if it is difficult to explain precisely how a county
 is different.
 In any event, since one track's weakeness is the other's strength, the
 parallel tracks are complementary.
 If consistent results are seen across both, it adds strength to the findings.
 Henceforth, the 
\begin_inset ERT

-dimensional track will be referred to as Track 1, while the PCA track will
 be referred to as Track 2.
 To complicate things just a little further, Track 1 also employs a limited
 dimensionality reduction protocol that will be known as Track 1a.
 The protocol in Track 1a first groups the original 16 expenditure functions
 into eight subgroups (Table

The second step of this protocol leverages the fact that our primary concern
 is the impact of COTEL intensity on fiscal behavior.
 Consequently, only those dimensions that are actually affected by TEL impositio

 In other words, inclusion in the final model is determined by whether or
 not the expenditure category has a meaningful relationship with COTEL intensity
, as indicated by a series of bivariate regressions.

It is interesting to note that the two dimension reduction procedures (PCA
 and regression selection) highlight different aspects of the fiscal portfolio.
 The variation in public works-related expenditures is a common theme, as

 This underscores the need for three flights of models using the distances

From an operational perspective, the clustering analysis was performed based
 upon fiscal positions in the PCA space.
 The reasons for this are two-fold.
 First, the dimension reduction techniques (PCA and regression filtering)
 allow us to distill down to three dimensions, which facilitates visualization.
 As it turns out, visualization is a very useful way of checking the face
 validity of the algorithm's output.
 Second, PCA is preferable relative to the regression filtering approach
 because it retains nearly all of the information in the original set.
 This is because the new dimensions are just complex combinations of the
 old dimensions, and the first three components explain 75.3% of the variation
 in the data (Figure

Recall that the major drawback of the PCA approach is the interpretation
 of movement along one of the compound dimensions that remain.
 However, if all that matters for this particular operation is the proximity
 of fiscal positions across counties, interpretation of the linear combinations
 of underlying dimensions is not the principal concern.
 Consequently, the space defined by PCA is unambiguously superior to the
 space defined by regression filtering for the purpose of identifying clusters
 of county fiscal preferences.

 this analysis tested a range of values for

 That being said, variance in group count,

 On the other hand, it is simply desirable to minimize the number of required
 groups because evaluating the dynamics of a group is less than useful if
 it has only a few members.
 To mitigate the tension between these two desirable properties and determine
 the number of clusters to be used for econometric analysis, three tests
 augmented visual inspection of clustering:
\end_layout

The first method evaluates the marginal contribution to

 of each cluster.
 The technique seeks to understand movement in the ratio of between-cluster
 variation to total variation in the sample.
 The desirable number of groups is then the value,

, at which the ratio increase over the interval 
\begin_inset ERT

 is significantly higher than the ratio increase over the interval 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 of each cluster.
 As previously indicated, this function decreases with increases in the
 number of groups

 When intersected with the first method, the result is a balancing of separation

The third method is a popular selection mechanism known as the

However, this view does some violence to the idea of constant covariance
 in within-cluster expenditure preferences.
 First, while we seek to identify within-cluster differences associated
 with COTELs, other differences capture inherent disimilarity as well.
 Second, there is an assumption that counties do not change types, but it
 is plausible that the variation seen in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:cty-clust-dist-var"

\end_inset

 would lead to different types at different times.
 Again, if this is due to COTELs, this is a useful finding.
 If it is due to other factors, it again highlights inherent disimilarity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, some weaknesses of the constant covariance approach certainly exist,
 but as discussed in Subsection

 Indeed, it was with this liability in mind that the decision was made to

 Do constrained jurisdictions deflect from their preferred expenditure bundles?
 It is hypothesized that any such deflection would be in the direction of
 providing a minimum bundle of services, and it is expected that the minimum
 bundle reflects a fairly consistent set of needs for any general purpose
 jurisdiction (Model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Therefore, paring down to the minimum bundle would limit the capacity of
 a given jurisdiction to distinguish itself from other jurisdictions.
 It is further expected that the impact of this convergence will be strongest
 in low-income jurisdictions, where resources are already constrained.
 The work of Mullins and Joyce

 responsibility to the state level, which also promotes uniformity in service

In effect, the model in this study suggests that institutional restrictions
 on revenue (e.g.
 tax and expenditure limitations) restrict the resources available to cover
 services that would allow a given jurisdiction to differentiate itself
 from others.
 In reality, this is a gross simplification.
 There is no natural boundary between revenues used to cover basic services
 and those used to cover the additional services preferred by constituents.
 In general, this model suggests convergence in expenditure behavior would
 stem from the imposition of COTELs.
\end_layout

\end_inset

If expenditure behavior shifts, a wedge is thrown between the realized and
 preferred tax-expenditure bundle for a given county.
 For prospective residents, the choice set is more limited, and the properties
 that may have drawn them to a particular county are less of a factor.
 For existing residents, an artificial difference has been created between
 the initial, expected utility that factored into the decision to site in
 the county and the realized utility after the expenditure shift has occurred.
 In practice, this may or may not lead to a reshuffling for those residents
 that can afford to move.
 Those that cannot simply experience a loss in utility.
 Furthermore, if the choices in close proximity lose some of their differentiati
on, the cost of relocating to a more

 county increases.
 In any event, understanding the impact of loss in differentiation is important

Our primary inquiry centers on whether or not the distance of a given county
 from the average preference position of counties of that type can be explained
 to some meaningful degree by the intensity of the COTEL constraint acting
 on said county.
 In measuring this, it is important to control for confounding economic
 processes that may impact cluster distance.
 These economic processes may occur in both the current observation's county,
 and the adjoining counties that may share bases of economic activity.
 In other words, the model must account for both the primary county, and
 the counties in the local neighborhood.

 It proves to be useful, but it would be more so if it varied over a greater

 Marginal impacts of regressors are easier to identify when they are associated
 with larger absolute spans in the range of dependent values.
 If a given dependent variable takes one of only two values, the contributions
 of each regressor is more difficult to distinguish relative to the case

 association increased in both cases.

 To the extent that these distributions neither perfectly overlap nor exhibit

 author with respect to cross-sectional action in county fiscal behavior.
 Given that county groups are not defined spatially, and thus members are
 often not close to each other, it seems quite plausible that the factors
 that may lead a county to part ways with group behavior are spatial factors
 which would not be shared across all members of the group.
 Thus, it is expected that spatial dependency, either through lags or errors,
 would need to be integrated into the analysis.

.
 While the global calculation does not permit the identification of hot
 spots, or clusters, within the state, it does have the advantage of providing
 a single statistic that captures the existence of clustering somewhere
 within the state.
 As such, we can evaluate clustering over time more easily.

There are three properties of the Figure

 that are of particular interest.
 First, the identification of spatial clustering varies dramatically across
 different measures of distance.
 Second, leading change measures are generally less spatially coherent than
 current year absolute measures.
 Third, the current year full portfolio distance measure is the only one
 that seems to exhibit spatial clustering over most of the period, 
\emph on
and that clustering intensity declines over time
\emph default
.
 In short, while it seems as though regional dynamics could play an outsized
 role in causing counties to stray from the behavior of their initial types,
 the data seem to suggest that this expectation is overstated.

Mill hints at the natural tension between those at either end of the inquiry
 spectrum, while simultanesouly recognizing that the differences between
 the poles are matters of degree, not concept.
 This is, in fact, an instructive point for the current situation.
 The a priori theoretical relationships hypothesized at the top of this
 section must be converted in an operational specification, which involves
 the selection and form of the variables used to represent said relationships.
 Ultimately, however, transformations can only make so much of a difference.
 In this case, the low explanatory power of the model presented was reasonably
 robust to an array of transformations of the variables presented.
 One must consider the implication: important elements are missing from
 the specification.

Fortunately, the context of this analysis is conducive to alternative methods

 These approaches are referred to as shrinkage, or regularization, methods
 (Algorithm

\end_inset

).
 Their utility extends beyond the specific use case for which they were
 designed.
 In general, they are useful for identifying the components of a dataset
 that are the best predictors.
 In contrast to filtering based on pairwise correlation or stepwise variable
 selection, they avoid the primary deficiency with discrete subset selection
 methods: comparatively high variance in predictive accuracy.
 Shrinkage methods rely instead on a continuous process for subset selection.
 In a nutshell, they penalize the sizes of the coefficient estimates.
 Since the loss function must now account for this penalty, the effect is
 to

shrink

 the estimates down until many of them are no longer meaningfully distinguished
 from zero.

One might reasonably ask whether or not the distance measures are in agreement
 about which factors matter the most.
 As previously argued, agreement across different implementations of fiscal
 behavior lends support to valid inference about the true drivers of fiscal
 behavior.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LASSO-Estimates-by-measure"

\end_inset

 directly compares the estimates from both versions (leading change and
 current level) of all three distance measures (full portfolio, regression
 filtered, and PCA).
 Estimates on the zero line have been virtually eliminated in the shrinkage
 process, and may thus be interpreted as immaterial predictors.
 Agreement across models is captured by estimates appearing on the same
 side of the zero line.
 Clearly, the closer the estimates are to each other, the stronger the agreement.
 If estimates fall on both sides of the line, as is the case for the level
 of state employment (
\begin_inset ERT

), support as a credible driver of fiscal behavior is reduced.
 Note that while the impacts are modest relative to federal employment (

) point consistently in the same direction across models.
 In general, they are associated with larger distances between a county
 and the centroid of its type, though the magnitude of the effect is not
 as substantial as other model components.
 In other words, they are associated with deviations in the expenditure
 trajectory of a given county.
 The Gallagher Ratio, on the other hand, seems to be more sensitive to distance
 measure.

While Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 has provided useful information regarding plausible drivers of fiscal behavior,
 it is generally advisable to use panel data when possible.
 The increase in the number of observations can increase precision (i.e.
 reduce estimate variance), while leveraging variation across time and space
 can improve accuracy (i.e.
 reduce estimate bias).
 The drawback is that the enhancement techniques leveraged in Subsection

 are not yet generally available to the best of the author's knowledge.

Developing reliable estimators of the shrinkage type is a task that just
 might exceed the capability of the author.
 Indirect approaches involving the transformation of input data are more
 achievable, but this effort has not been pursued in the context of this
 inquiry.

 Furthermore, as will become apparent, the fixed effect techniques used
 here substantially diminish the explained variation in fiscal behavior
 over the pooled case.

To establish why simple reliance on the pooled case may be problematic,
 one can evaluate the behavior of the residuals.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Comparison-of-Residual-behavior"

\end_inset

 compares the distribution of residual values for pooled and fixed effect
 models.
 The separation of central tendency from the zero line in the pooled case
 is a measurement of the bias in the estimates.
 Note that this bias is markedly reduced in the fixed effect case, and variance
 is reduced as well.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Pooled-Residuals-by-county"

 depicts the distributions of residuals by county.
 The implication is that unobserved county-specific effects are distorting
 the estimates from the pooled model.
 In effect, the aspects we do not measure may interact with those that we
 do measure in unexpected ways.

 point for building a narrative.
 In Table

, it can be seen that the Gallagher Ratio (
\begin_inset ERT

 across models.
 The sign of the COTEL intensity (

) estimates suggest that it is also associated with larger cluster distances,
 although not with the same magnitude or precision as the Gallagher Ratio.
 These results, even if only weakly supported in the COTEL intensity case,
 suggest that COTELs are associated with forcing counties to make different
 decisions.

To mitigate the heteroskedastic factors discussed above, two flights of
 fixed effect models have also been evaluated.
 The first incorporates county fixed effects (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Fixed-Effect-Results-county"

\end_inset

) and the second incoroporates both county and year fixed effects (Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Fixed-Effect-Results-county-year"

\end_inset

).
 These flights paint a very different story for COTELs.
 In the county fixed effect model, neither COTEL intensity nor the Gallagher
 Ratio is a meaningful predictor of cluster distance.
 In the two-way model, both measures go negative! The effect can dissipate
 when utilizing fixed effects for at least two reasons.
 The first is that COTELs do not actually lead to changes in expenditure
 behavior.
 Rather, they are correlated in the pooled case because of action in a third
 variable.
 For example, counties that capture a higher proportion of all government
 expenditure may simply be more likely to be constrained by COTELs because
 these jurisdictions are, in fact, trying to do more at the county level.
 Expenditure proportion is the only component of our fiscal space definition
 that does not speak to expenditure patterns, and most counties exhibit
 a relatively narrow range of variation in this proportion.
 Fixed effects wash out consistent differences across units, so we may have
 washed out the impact of expenditure proportion to a large extent, which
 would drop the amount of variation COTELs can explain.
 For this to hold, however, a strong level of association between county
 expenditure proportions and COTEL measures.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:County-Fiscal-Proportion-Assoc-COTEL"

\end_inset

 demonstrates that the association between these concepts is quite unremarkable.

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, fixed effects may be washing out too much variation in general
 across counties.
 This lack of variation would increase the difficulty in measuring the significa
nce of any model component.
 Indeed, we see that the model fit has dropped dramatically, as has the
 impact of nearly all independent variables.
 This is, however, tough to square with the clarity of signal for our COTEL
 variables in the two-way model, which explains even less total variation
 in cluster distance than the county fixed effect model.
 In the two-way model, COTELs are consistently a driver of smaller cluster
 differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author posits that these findings reflect a mechanism that violates
 the original hypothesis.
 COTELs may well force counties to change expenditures in a way that conflicts
 with underlying preferences, but this change may actually mean that counties
 are not free to differentiate themselves as they otherwise would.
 Said differently, COTELs push counties that want to change types to stay
 put.
 How is it then, that the OLS model showed a positive relationship? This
 is likely due to the fact that both the median cluster distance and COTEL
 values are increasing over time, although the increase in the former is
 modest.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No single element of any of the specifications used in this analysis displayed
 fully consistent impacts across all models.
 Given that over 60 models have been presented in the chapter, and given
 the discussion of ensemble approaches in Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Econometrics-as-Observation"

\end_inset

, perhaps this is not so problematic.
 There do seem to be, for our purposes, some general trends of note.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, and foremost, the positive relationship between COTEL intensity (
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$intensity
\backslash
_stock$
\end_layout

\end_inset

) and our measures of changes in expenditure behavior, cluster distance
 (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$dist_clust*$
\end_layout

\end_inset

) was a fairly consistent phenomenon until time was addressed.
 This accords with intuition.
 It makes theoretical sense that jurisdictions that experience greater constrain
ts on the ability to raise revenue will be forced to modify the menu of
 services they can feasibly finance, and that the cumulative effect over
 time would make this more acute.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship to the Gallagher ratio, however, is a bit more murky in
 both theoretical and empirical contexts.
 From a theoretical standpoint, it is difficult to parse the residential
 share of the property tax burden from a prevailing preference for or against
 expenditure decisions.
 One could posit that counties with higher residential shares are more likely
 to behave similarly at the outset.
 Changing that share may not alter that preferential correlation.
 Sure enough, the empirical analysis did little to sort this out.

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it is also true that there are a number of other, often more important,
 factors that drive changes in expenditure patterns, a central message can
 be gleaned from the analysis.
 In all likelihood, institutional restrictions matter for local fiscal choices.
 Policy officials must, and measurably do, adapt to these constraints.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is clear that COTELs have changed the operating space for local fiscal
 managers in Colorado.
 The designers did, however, leave room for local autonomy.
 Local jurisdictions retained the right to exempt themselves from limitation,
 making room for a useful social inquiry.
 If local jurisdictions had the freedom to opt out, was the imposition of
 COTELs actually a means to better align constituent preferences and fiscal
 outcomes? Had the absence of COTELs enabled a disconnect between constituent
 desires and the actions of local public finance officials?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These motivating questions harken back to the discussion of TELs as instruments
 of democracy in Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:TELs-as-democracy"

\end_inset

.
 TELs are generally blunt objects, but they may serve as an attractive way
 to circumvent regular order, which may suffer from perceived deficiencies.
 As such, they may very well push fiscal outcomes towards accordance with
 constituent preferences.
 The question is whether or not the cure is worse than the disease.
 Chapters 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 explored limited aspects of this question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter partially explores the same question from a different angle.
 Before one can compare the

cure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

disease
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, one must understand the extent to which the disease is a problem.
 In other words, we must identify voter preferences before we know if COTELs
 lead fiscal outcomes to converge on them.
 Since we do not directly observe voter preferences, identifying them is
 no small ask.
 It requires assumptions about how to synthesize the events that we can
 observe, and even then it is a multi-stage research program.
 This chapter takes only the first step.
 It explores whether or not the outcomes of local overrides, or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 attempts, can be anticipated based upon county conditions and ballot design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
How Can Voter Preferences be Revealed?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we cannot observe the preference schedules of constituents, we are
 compelled to rely on phenomenon that we can observe.
 This study assumes that ballot outcomes are valid observations of the utility
 mechanism that underlies political expression in a county, and the preference
 schedules of all its residents.
 This is, to be sure, a strong assumption if for no other reason than voting
 participation rates being nowhere near 100%.
 These initiatives, however, do provide our best information.
 They can be made to perform some work with some additional assumptions
 about the structural properties of the preferences that serve as inputs
 into voting outcomes.
 Given this framework, the path forward is understanding the drivers of
 ballot outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anticipation of ballot outcomes is a composite inquiry because there are
 two components to a county's decision to exempt itself from TABOR and/or
 SLPTR.
 First, what is the baseline propensity to exempt? That counties differ
 in their desire to raise and spend public funds is a natural corollary
 to Tiebout's hypothesis.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Tiebout1956"

\end_inset

 To extend this view by positing that this preference differential could
 be manifested in differing baseline propensities to exempt is not an unreasonab
le prior belief.
 This study chapter seeks to update this prior belief with empirical observation
 of the actual outcomes of exemption votes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, given an estimated baseline propensity to exempt, to what extent
 does the construction of the exemption impact the likelihood of success?
 It turns out that exemptions are far from identical.
 Each of them is uniquely constructed -- each is a function of both the
 needs of the jurisdiction and the designer's estimated chances of successful
 passage.
 To state the question differently, given the county's political environment,
 which aspects of the ballot are likely to garner sufficient support? Which
 aspects are most problematic?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To understand whether or not exemption votes can be anticipated, this study
 takes a two part estimation approach.
 It does so in an effort to provide actionable intelligence for local policymake
rs.
 In this light, the sole objective of the establishment of a baseline propensity
 to exempt is to determine whether or not it can be identified from practically
 intrinsic features of the county.
 Characteristics of a constituent population do not change rapidly.
 From the perspective of a local official, policy options take the current
 population's sentiment as a given property.
 From a methodological perspective, this is constraining and liberating
 at the same time.
 It is constraining insofar as we cannot use policy actions (like previous
 votes, or lack thereof) as regressors in the prediction of future vote
 outcomes.
 To do so would conflate underlying constituent preferences with the design
 elements in the proposals tested in previous votes.
 On the other hand, it is liberating insofar as policymakers can focus on
 ballot design.
 Thus, as researchers, we can focus on predictive accuracy.
 Among other things, this facilitates the use of a larger suite of predictive
 tools, including those that operate well in high-dimensional space.

In addition to superior performance in high-dimensional regressor space,
 it ultimately became apparent that votes on the

 side of the decision boundary also had to be accommodated.
 In this regard, not all classification approaches are created equal.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second stage, we can use the first stage result to condition the
 analysis of ballot design.
 In traditional policy literature, this is done by inserting the result
 of a probit model as a regressor in the second stage equation.
 We will parallel this approach by including a probability estimate of support
 vector classification in the second stage.

The Revealed Preference Construct
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Revealed-Preference"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use historical ballot initiative outcomes as the basis for understanding
 the preferences of voters, one must grapple with the nature of choice.
 Without some minimal structure, the past choices of individuals or groups
 is quickly rendered meaningless for the purpose of predicting future choices.
 Consider a scenario in which an individual must select from a set of three
 choices, 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$S =
\backslash
{A,B,C
\backslash
}$
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In the absence of any other information, we must assign equal probabilities
 to the choice among items 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$A$
\end_layout

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$B$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$C$
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 That is, in predicting the individual's choice or understanding the individual'
s expected utility form among the options, we can do no better than apply
 a uniform prior belief.
 Suppose now that the individual selected item 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$B$
\end_layout

\end_inset

, and is tasked with selecting from the original set, 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$S =
\backslash
{A,B,C
\backslash
}$
\end_layout

\end_inset

, a second time.
 We now have a situation in which we have knowledge of the set and additional
 information which may be used to affect our prior belief about the individual's
 bias towards a particular item.
 The question is, to what extent do we allow the supplementary information
 to affect our anticipation of the impending choice and our understanding
 of the individual's preference schedule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One might reasonably inquire into the value of taking pains to precisely
 define the relationship between historical information and the current
 choice.
 Is it not obvious that a reasonable person would expect the consistent
 selection of 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$B$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 given the same set? In fact, that a prior choice controls is a nontrivial
 assumption.
 There are any number of reasons that that choices may be inconsistent.
 For a truly random number generator, it is not desirable to have a consistent
 choice of an item from a set.
 For an offensive coordinator on a football team's coaching staff, the element
 of surprise is actually an asset.
 Alternatively, in choosing the policies under which a voter must live,
 consistency seems to be more of a virtue, insofar as it confers benefits
 in siting and investment decisions.
 It is, however, important to 1) be explicit about the assumption, 2) be
 cognizant of the manner in which it can affect interpretation, and 3) be
 cautious about the results one obtains by way of the assumption.
 Furthermore, being precise about this relationship allows for clearer analysis
 of more complicated scenarios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this in mind, the analysis here leans on Samuelson's rather famous
 weak axiom of revealed preference (Algorithm
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:WARP"

\end_inset

).
 In effect, the axiom says that past choices do control when one seeks to
 construct a preference schedule.
 Said differently, the preferences of an individual do not change as a consequen
ce of the available choices or the number of selections that may be made.

 A complicating factor is that the status quo does not remain constant,

This is surely great news if the representative county voter is choosing
 between eating an apple or eating an orange.
 The analysis of deBrucing efforts, however, is complicated significantly
 by two factors.
 First, establishment of the representative voter is far from a simple task.
 Much of voting literature is built upon the concept of the median voter.

 Reversing the dimensionality reduction required to make this approach tractable
 has proven remarkably difficult.
 Even if a voter's preferences can be placed in space, strong assumptions
 about the way that space is constructed across voters are required to develop
 a distribution of positions for a given population.
 This, of course, assumes that we can observe all of the relevant dimensions.

The curse of dimensionality refers to the idea that observations tend to
 get further away from the point being estimated in high dimensions.

 uniformly distributed.
 Suppose one is concerned with only a single dimension, 
\begin_inset ERT

These complications represent obstacles to a fuller articulation of preferences.

\begin_layout Subsection
Methodological Approach and Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter seeks to explore exemption behavior from the perspective of
 ballot design.
 For local policymakers, it asks which components should a ballot include
 to increase the probability of successful passage? In practice, this is
 a composite inquiry.
 To understand the marginal impact of ballot components, one must first
 understand how likely a given community is to pass
\emph on
 any
\emph default
 ballot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consequently, the analysis employs a two-stage estimation routine, a common
 approach when dealing with latent factors.
 In the first stage, we will seek to establish a baseline propensity to
 pass exemptions for each county in Colorado.
 This baseline propensity is necessarily separated from elements of ballot
 design.
 It is a function of only socioeconomic indicators.
 Once this baseline propensity is established for each county, it serves
 as an instrument in the second stage equation, which evaluates the marginal
 impact of ballot components (e.g.
 an increase in the property tax rate) on successful passage.
\end_layout

What is the Expected Impact of COTELs?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter uses the same property tax-centric construction of COTELs presented
 in Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:TEL-operationalization"

\end_inset

: the composite limit imposed by TABOR/SLPTR (
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

) and the Gallagher Ratio (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$prop
\backslash
_ratio$
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Both measures are therefore capturing some element of the resource scarcity
 that can occur as a consequence of the intersection between COTELs and
 the prevailing economic activity in a given county.
 However, fiscal stress is a function of both revenue supply and expenditure
 need.
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$intensity
\backslash
_stock$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 only partially captures expenditure need, insofar as the allowable growth
 in revenues is in part determined by the construction of new housing units.
 Furthermore, the constraint component of the variable captures growth in
 the value of housing stock, which can partially serve as a proxy for a
 more robust concept of economic growth.
 If public services are generally normal goods, we expect constituents to
 demand more of them with increasing resources.
 Consequently, an additional component of expenditure need is captured in
 part by 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$intensity
\backslash
_stock$
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 By contrast, 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$prop
\backslash
_ratio$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 does not include any components related to economic growth.
 It captures only the mix of stock in the property tax base.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since these measures only partially capture indirect measures of expenditure
 need, the analysis employs controls based on additional proxies.
 The first stage equation uses a diverse range of socioeconomic indicators
 that can account for demand side factors.
 The second stage, however, is focused entirely on ballot design.
 It incorporates demand factors indirectly via the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

baseline propensity to exempt
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 variable estimated in the first stage equation.
 Thus, the entire analysis hinges on capturing demand characteristics in
 the socioeconomic indicators used in the first stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implicit assumption in this construction is that these votes are very
 much a function of fiscal stress.
 One can reasonably posit that counties experiencing fiscal stress are generally
 more likely to make additional requests for more resources by way of deBrucing
 votes.
 Furthermore, one would expect that if the constituents feel sufficient
 pain from underprovided services, they would be more likely to accept the
 proposed exemption.
 There are three issues that complicate this linkage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The decision to accept or reject a deBrucing proposal is likely to depend
 on both fiscal stress 
\emph on
and voter preferences
\emph default
.
 If voters find the prospect of increased collections as too painful, they
 may be willing to absorb the costs associated with underprovision.
 This preference is expected to vary across counties, and it is exactly
 this phenomenon that estimating baseline propensity to exempt seeks to
 accommodate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Preferences aside, voters may actually be taxed at a high rate.
 In other words, increasing revenue collection from the base is generally
 more feasible if the starting level of tax effort is relatively low, and
 vice versa.
 Thus, one would expect counties with fewer economic resources to have a
 more difficult time accepting deBrucing proposals.
 Differential endowments are captured in the socioeconomic indicators employed
 in the first stage equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Not all deBrucing proposals are created equal.
 Some proposals ask for more revenue than others.
 Furthermore, the type and scope of revenue can elicit different responses
 from the voters, 
\emph on
even if the overall level of revenue is held constant
\emph default
.
 The design elements of ballots captured in the second stage equation are
 intended to account for these effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If expenditure need, preferences, and resource endowments are accommodated,
 it is hypothesized that the voting outcomes are a function of revenue supply.
 Revenue supply, in turn, is captured by the institutional variables discussed
 above.
 
\emph on
Ceterus paribus, institutional constraints on revenue supply are expected
 to decouple revenue growth from expenditure need and create fiscal stress.
 This fiscal stress is expected to lead to higher rates of deBrucing vote
 passage.

\emph default
 The only situation in which this relationship ought to break down is when
 the deBrucing effort seeks to raise property taxes.
 To the extent that higher Gallagher ratios mean that residential voters
 would bear a higher proportion of such an increase, we would expect an
 inverse relationship between vote passage and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$prop
\backslash
_ratio$
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In practice, of course, the level of variation in votes that can be explained
 is limited by the indirect nature of the linkage, measurement error in
 the dependent and controls, and a limited number of observations in high
 dimensional space.

 Given these revenue and expenditure patterns, the consumer-voter moves

\begin_layout Standard
Since Tiebout's hypothesis was first published, an enormous amount of literature
 has examined the veracity of this proposal.
 An exhaustive review of the literature is outside of the scope of this
 inquiry, but in general the prevailing wisdom suggests that sorting of
 this nature is only one piece of the puzzle.
 Nevertheless, it is an important piece, insofar as we do see heterogeneity
 in the preference patterns of local governments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This variation in preferences is reflected not only in the policies that
 individual constituencies demand, but also in the operating contexts of
 each jurisdiction.
 Counties in Colorado, for example, vary dramatically in age profiles, industria
l bases, political disposition, crime rates, and desire to consume public
 services among other things.
 For example, the median count of residents employed by either state or
 local government was 1,060 in 2007.
 The county with the least employees in subnational government (San Juan),
 however, had only 69.
 The county with the most (Denver) had 58,252.
 This variation suggests that counties will differ in their attitudes towards
 tax and expenditure limitations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this component of the chapter is to identify a latent property
 of each county that taps into this preference variation.
 Since we cannot observe it directly, we rely on the intersection of characteris
tics we can observe to construct a proxy.

The Problem Set Up
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In effect, this is a classification problem.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Classification is characterized by a binary response, while regression is
 characterized by a continuous response.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The response variable is a binary indicator of successful exemption.
 If the vote passed, it is coded as one; votes that fail to pass are coded
 as zero.
 The design matrix (i.e.
 regressor set) is comprised of 521 variables taken from the USA Counties
 database.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be sure, there are many more variables in the database.
 The USA Counties data, however, present a challenge.
 All of the data are pulled from a broad mix of agencies and programs, each
 with its own reporting frequency.
 In their raw state, the data are quite sparse.
 A full discussion of the deliberation surrounding considered imputation
 approaches is beyond the scope of this chapter, but in the end, the approach
 taken sought to use the information in the data, and make no further distributi
onal assumptions.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An alternative approach involved applying a multivariate normal prior.
 This approach resulted in a number of infeasible values and did not improve
 the separability of vote coutcomes.
 In other words, it did not perform better than the chosen approach from
 the perspective of prediction.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In practice, this was interpreted as applying a uniform prior to the unknown
 annual 
\emph on
changes
\emph default
.
 This was operationalized as linear interpolation between observed data
 points within each county, and extrapolation of the long-term trend (that
 which was implied by all observed data points) outside of the interpolation
 support.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Selection of a Classifier
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once complete cases had been constructed, a suitable classifier had to be
 chosen.
 To understand the rationale for this choice, observe Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Voting-Outcomes-PCA"

\end_inset

.
 To visualize the spread of voting outcomes, principal component analysis
 was performed on the USA Counties data.
 In the rotated basis, over 96% of the variation was explained by the first
 two principal components.
 Therefore, plotting in the plane formed by these two principal components
 provides a useful view of vote spread.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The typical candidate for estimating the probability of an outcome is the
 probit regression model, particularly when the estimate is to be used in
 a second stage equation.
 In this case, however, the probit estimater has a number of drawbacks.
 First, link function estimators of this type
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 impose distributional assumptions on the data, which is unnecessary for
 this task.
 Second, probit models rely on linear separating hyperplanes.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If we were operating in two-dimensional space, as depicted in the principal
 component plots of Figure

 The probit estimator was also evaluated for the estimation of probabilities.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 represent a class of estimators that are well suited to remedy these issues.
 Effectively, they employ kernels to project the data into a higher-dimensional
 space that permits linear separability.
 To provide a very simplified example, if one were to imagine the subplots
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 actually depended on only two dimensions, linear separability would not
 be strictly possible.
 SVM could, however, project the two-dimensional data into three dimensions
 and find that linear separability is possible in the third dimension.
 This projection capacity means that SVM can create highly non-linear separating
 hyperplanes in the original data space.

In a nutshell, this feature provides more flexibility in separating groups

 side of the decision boundary (i.e.
 the separating hyperplane).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The drawbacks of the approach involve probability interpretations of the
 results and the difficulty with which the impact of each dimension can
 be interpreted.
 Both tasks involve post hoc manipulation of the estimator output, as opposed
 to directly falling out the typical estimator output as they would with
 a probit model.
 With respect to the former, a little extra work (via Platt Scaling) returns
 the probability of successful passage for our purposes.
 With respect to the latter, interpretation of all 521 variables in the
 model is not our primary goal (as stated in the beginning of the chapter).
 The goal is accurate prediction, and a viable second stage instrument.

\begin_layout Subsection
Usefulness of Prediction

\begin_layout Standard
The parameters of the classifier were identified by way of a grid search
 algorithm, which selects the intersection of input parameter values that
 maximizes a cross-validated accuracy score.
 Once the optimal estimator was identified, the outcomes of each vote were
 predicted based upon county characteristics from the USA Counties data.
 Keeping in mind that SVM provided the most accurate prediction of all tested
 classifiers, we predicted the vote outcomes accurately 58.3% of the time.
 
\emph on
This outcome suggests that socioeconomic characteristics of a given county
 are not dominant drivers of vote outcomes.

What is the Impact of Ballot Design?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the baseline propensity to pass an exemption established for each county,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Operationalizing Ballot Elements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Standardizing votes for use with any estimator involves judgments about
 the important elements of the ballot.
 Ultimately, the information in each ballot record was coerced into a schema
 characterized by three groups: revenue source, expenditure target, and
 scope of the change.
 The first two groups house binary concepts (Tables

\begin_layout Subsection
Measuring the Impact of Ballot Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To measure the impact of design, this chapter employs three different classes
 of estimators for two different response variables: binary passage and
 continuous percentage of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 votes.
 The binary response warranted a classifier, and for this purpose both logistic
 and probit regression have been evaluated.
 Unlike the previous prediction effort, interpretation of individual factors
 is a higher priority.
 Both the logistic and probit classifier outputs are closer to that which
 is typical of regression estimators.
 This property facilitates comparison to the third model, ordinary least
 squares regression for the continuous response.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OLS regression is not strictly optimal for proportional responses, because
 it does not bound the predicted values in the [0,100] interval.
 Furthermore, the estimates can generally be biased.
 However, our purpose is to identify the most consistent design elements
 across specifications.
 If a consistent ranking is prevalent, one could capture even more relevant
 information.
 From the perspective of a policy official, the precise estimate is of less
 concern than the general direction and some notion of magnitude.
 It should also be noted that even though OLS (in this case, a linear probabilit
y model) does not share the same asymptotic properties as the logit or probit,
 marginal effects can be extracted if the model is well behaved.
 As it turns out, in this case, the error behavior does in fact suggest
 that the model is well behaved.

\begin_layout Standard
The first aspect to note is the fit of the three models.
 The classifiers perform better than the zero information case; both accurately
 predict about 69% of the time.
 The OLS model explains only approximately 18% of variation
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This value reflects the adjusted

\end_layout

\end_inset

 in the proportion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 votes.
 These metrics suggest that the combination of the baseline propensity and
 ballot design (as operationalized) do not fully explain outcomes.
 Parsing out the remaining sources of explanation, such as fiscal indicators,
 is a subject for future inquiry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, it can be seen that the most consistent factor in successful outcomes
 in all three runs is the baseline propensity to exempt (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$prob
\backslash
_exmpt$
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 It is both substantively and statistically significant in all three models.
 In fact, there is no other model component that clearly increases probability
 of passage by such a magnitude.
 There are, however, multiple components that substantially drop the probability
 of passage.
 Most notably, voters seem to strongly dislike proposals for administrative
 tasks and unspecified choices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the classifiers do not yield significant results for
 the cumulative impact of TABOR and SLPTR (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$intensity
\backslash
_stock$
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Furthermore, the sign in the OLS model conflicts with theory.
 One would expect that the greater the constraint placed upon a given county,
 the more likely an exemption vote would be.
 It is quite possible that this is a consequence of an endogenous relationship.
 Rather than being motivated by COTEL intensity to pass an exemption vote,
 the intensity may itself arise because voters aren't passing exemption
 votes.
 Simply evaluating the relationship between results and lagged COTEL intensity
 or lagged percentage change in COTEL intensity does not resolve the issue.
 Developing a method to tease out this relationship in more detail is a
 subject for future work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gallagher Ratio (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$prop
\backslash
_ratio$
\end_layout

\end_inset

) also conflicts with theory.
 To reiterate, the ratio is the residential assessment base value over the
 non-residential assessment base value.
 Thus, the share of the burden from a property tax increase is borne by
 voters is actually higher with higher Gallagher ratios, which suggests
 that an inverse relationship with successful exemption should be observed.
 The author speculates that this is likely an artifact of the specification,
 due to the joint distribution of the constraint variable and other model
 components.
 For example, ballots in counties with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Gallagher Ratios (those above the median value) are 11% less likely to
 include sales tax changes, 13% less likely to include open ended waivers,
 and 19% less likely to have property tax changes.
 As can be seen in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Ballot-Design-Results"

\end_inset

, all of these components drop the likelihood of passage.
 This accords with a certain logic, insofar as counties with high Gallagher
 ratios may employ officials that are unwilling to put property tax increases
 on the ballot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, the estimation strategy has proven fruitful insofar as it has
 identified several drivers of ballot outcomes, and the importance of preference
s.
 Now that identification has occurred, precise estimation of marginal effects
 remains a subject for future study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decision by a county to exempt itself, in full or in part, from the
 constraints of TELs in Colorado is a multifaceted one.
 It depends on the underlying attitudes of the population, which this study
 and earlier work has proven difficult to estimate.
 It also depends on the components of the proposed initiative, which has
 been demonstrated here.
 Determining the precise impact of each component, however, remains an elusive
 goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter represents only a single step in research that aims to provide
 local policymakers with sufficient information to judge future exemption
 efforts.
 Moreover, it provides context for states considering the adoption of TELs
 that parallel the structure of TABOR, SLPTR, and/or the Gallagher Amendment.
 The Colorado example holds lessons regarding the complexity of the interaction
 between these TELs and the socioeconomic circumstance of individual counties.
 In the context of future research, it is important to understand what exemption
 votes look like, and the ease with which extenuating circumstances like
 fiscal stress can be accommodated.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study has explored the overlapping impacts of TABOR, SLPTR, and the
 Gallagher Amendment in Colorado.
 In so doing, the analysis seeks to shed light on intergovernmental linkages
 writ large.
 The decisions made at one level of government most certainly have implications
 for policymakers at other levels, particularly as one moves down in jurisdictio
nal scope.
 From an institutional perspective, these changes are not absolute.
 However, they do violence to the structure of the political economy that
 prevails prior to their implementation.
 Indeed, it is with this goal that such measures are often pursued.
 By that narrow standard, if implemented, the author believes that they
 must be considered a success.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A broader definition of success, however, evaluates the implications of
 the shift from regular order.
 Are constituents better off as a consequence? To answer this question,
 one must capture value judgments across alternative states in an unambiguous
 way.
 Taking a shot at an answer to this question is necessarily beyond the scope
 of this analysis for (at least) two reasons.
 First, and most practically, the author lacks access to any data that even
 approaches precise measures of the utility functions for each constituent,
 or at least some measure of central tendency.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:DeBrucing"

\end_inset

 opens the door on preference revelation, but this must be seen as only
 a proxy of the roughest kind.
 Second, it is not clear that any absolute answer exists.
 Why should we expect that even if a utility maximizing revenue-expenditure
 bundle could be identified at time 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$t$
\end_layout

\end_inset

, that it would be either the same at 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$t+n$
\end_layout

\end_inset

, or possess properties that would permit its use in predicting an optimal
 bundle at 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$t+n$
\end_layout

\end_inset

? Populations, and the context in which they live, change.
 It seems likely that prevailing preferences are a function of at least
 these two things.
 For these reasons, this analysis has not focused on whether changes are
 good or bad, but rather on whether or not changes have occurred at all.
 From here, we can at least speak to operational implications, if not abstract
 value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On this front, this study has reviewed the history of tax and expenditure
 limitations, as well as scholarly documentation of their effects.
 To the extent that students of TELs find, more often than not, that TELs
 alter fiscal behavior, this study continues that narrative.
 The value add has been essentially in the area of measurement.
 This study advanced the idea that spatial relationships across jurisdictions
 matter in a more robust way than had been attempted in the past.
 While some studies have focused on intra-metropolitan areas, this study
 exhausted the state, relating all counties to those around them.
 It also provided a novel way of measuring TEL impact.
 The two continuous measures employed, COTEL intensity and the Gallagher
 ratio, provide finer measures of actual TEL constraints than do the binary
 and/or index measures that have dominated the existing literature.
 As Mullins has demonstrated 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mullins2004"

\end_inset

, the context in which a county operates has substantial implications for
 its ability absorb such restrictions.
 
\emph on
The approach taken here permits exploration of this context in a way that
 has not been done before, and in so doing, provided a way to speak to the
 behavior both within and across counties.
 
\emph default
It is perhaps comforting that, in light of these attempts to pursue tighter
 measurement, the prevailing theme persists.
 TELs do have an impact, and now we can see what that impact is on a specific
 county.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That being said, the findings from the analysis present a view that suggests
 TEL impacts are relatively modest in the scheme of things.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:RevYieldCapacity"

\end_inset

 demonstrated that COTELs depress revenue, but that should be true almost
 by construction.
 They have some problematic implications for exaggerating fiscal clustering
 among low income jurisdictions, but there is no measurable impact on economic
 capacity.
 Granted, the linkages are long here, but ultimately capacity is what we
 want to know about.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Expenditure-Patterns"

\end_inset

 revealed that COTELs are likely to shift expenditure behavior from the
 trajectory that might otherwise have occurred, albeit modestly.
 The magnitude of that shift is dominated by demographic factors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:DeBrucing"

\end_inset

 was materially different than, but contextually relied upon, the preceding
 chapters.
 Rather than focus on the impacts of COTELs, the final empirical chapter
 sought to explore institutional machinery.
 Insofar as it identified a few ballot components that have comparatively
 important effects on the likelihood of the passage of a deBrucing vote,
 its provides some limited intelligence for policymakers.
 The surprising element from this analysis again highlights the importance
 of socioeconomic context.
 The prevailing propensity of a county to pass any exemption vote was identified
 as being at least as important as the most critical design choices.
 Even if local managers cannot change the prevailing propensity, it should
 materially affect their strategic decisionmaking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Next Steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ultimately, the analysis presented here has only scratched the surface of
 the three topics addressed in the empirical chapters.
 To be candid, future work in the areas evaluated here would require a deeper
 dive.
 For one thing, better methods of mitigating spatial and temporal non-stationari
ty would have to be developed.
 Second, the acquisition of better fiscal data for the other governments
 in the county would be a material addition.
 At the current time, the analysis relies on a rather unsatisfying imputation
 from the USA Counties Database.
 Unfortunately, the school district fiscal data early in the study period
 has proven elusive.
 Given that information, school district and municipal finances could be
 proportionally allocated to the counties that contain them.
 Additionally, an enormous amount of work could be done exploring different
 definitions of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

local neighborhoods
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This study has employed two grouping definitions, based upon first order
 contiguity and position in fiscal space.
 However, there are a large variety of directions that could be explored.
 Finally, a great deal more work could be done in the selection of estimators.
 For example, relatively straightforward transformations can be applied
 to OLS specifications to mitigate AR(1) dependence structures (e.g.
 the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Prais-Winsten "
target "http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/panelAR/panelAR.pdf"

\end_inset

 approach).
 Such methodological improvements could improve the precision and accuracy
 of the estimates dramatically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Substantively, not enough is known about TELs and the business cycle, from
 the perspective of individual jurisdictions.
 It is reasonable to suppose that the expectations and behavior of local
 fiscal managers changes in response to prevailing business conditions,
 not just in Colorado but elsewhere as well.
 The dynamic effect of changing revenue profiles is a material characteristic
 of binding TELs, and it would behoove local managers to better understand
 this action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, while the COTEL intensity measures used in this study have increased
 the information we can capture about TEL effects, they are far from perfect.
 At the very least, they rely on assessment data and imperfect assumptions
 about starting conditions.
 Ideally, a better implementation would also incorporate information about
 voter preferences, although reconciling the endogeneity in this approach
 is a non-trivial concern.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, this work served as a highly imperfect first step.
 From that perspective, it has in part been motivated by a desire to incite
 future research.
 Furthermore, it has sought to encourage new ways of addressing old problems,
 in the hopes that future work may provide fresh insights that may have
 previously been hidden by prevailing practice.
 With any luck, it has at least partially succeeded on these fronts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Appendix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed in Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:SubFinUS"

\end_inset

, comprehension of TELs is well served by understanding the additional reforms
 in play before and during the growth in the TEL movement.
 The discussion of these reforms is continued here, stratified into three
 groups: targeted on-neutralities, neutral reforms, and general restrictions.
 In general, these reforms stem from what Mullins refers to as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

love-hate relationship
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Mullins2010"

\end_inset

 Despite a reduction in proportional significance, the property tax remains
 a stalwart of local public finance, and for good reason.
 Despite the legitimate criticisms levied by Seligman and others, the tax
 is a reliable, immobile generator of revenue.
 Moreover, when polled, residents seem to be reasonably satisfied with the
 local services that rely heavily on the tax.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That being said, the visibility of the property tax does come with popular
 backlash.
 Surveys reveal the tax to be perceived as the worst or most unfair tax.
 The levy is always in the spotlight, and residents often feel the collection
 acutely.
 It is the disdain that accompanies these characteristics that has led to
 a host of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

relief
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 reforms, many of which are discussed below.
 That said reforms render the tax less effective and efficient, there can
 be no doubt.
 However, if these reforms are the path by which the property tax remains
 a viable portion of the local revenue portfolio, these may be small costs
 to pay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Targeted Non-Neutralities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Circuit Breakers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the challenges in researching relief mechanisms is the establishment
 of definitions that provide clear delineations across different policy
 alternatives.
 The variety in implementation that occurs for these relief mechanisms creates
 an environment in which considerable grey areas arise in classification.
 Bowman notes that these arise because all property tax relief measures
 necessarily act on one of three things: the tax base, the tax rate, or
 the income of the taxpayer.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bowman2009"

\end_inset

 In particular, the potential to confuse homestead exemptions and circuit
 breakers is particularly high.
 For this reason, this section will use Bowman's definition of circuit breakers.
 The key criterion for qualification as a circuit breaker is
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

an inverse relationship, over a significant range of income, between income
 and tax relief amounts for a givene property tax amount.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 There are two classes of circuit breakers that exist:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Threshold Circuit Breakers
\emph default
 exempt all property tax liability that exceeds a given percentage of income;
 and,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Sliding Scale Circuit Breakers
\emph default
 exempt a given percentage of the property tax liability based upon the
 income bracket in which the taxpayer resides.
 The exemption level decreases with each successively higher income bracket
 and it phases out entirely at a statutorily defined threshold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example will clarify the need to define these items explicitly.
 Tennessee has enacted a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

circuit breaker
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 relief program that reimbursed senior citizens for taxes paid on the first
 $250,000 of market value.
 There is no phase out, nor is there a reference to income.
 This is actually a targeted homestead deduction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impact of circuit breakers on property tax revenues requires empirical
 discovery.
 On the one hand, circuit breakers can increase the propensity of the constituen
t base to accept tax increases.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bowman2008"

\end_inset

 To the extent that a voter already owes the maximum allowable percentage
 of their property value, votes for increased property taxes carry no additional
 cost.
 On the other hand, circuit breakers directly decrease the property tax
 base, thereby potentially increasing liabilities for everyone else.
 Consequently, this instrument does particularly well to stoke tensions
 in the politicial space (voters abover the threshold versus voters below
 the threshold) that serve as an instrinsic characteristic of public finance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Colorado has no general statewide circuit breaker
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, but some relief is provided conditional on senior status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Homestead Exemptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The homestead exemption was a product of the housing issues experienced
 during the Great Depression.
 At the time, the incomes of taxpayers were plummeting, creating untenable
 property tax liabilities for much of the citizenry.
 The response to this issue in 14 states was an exemption on a predefined
 portion of property value.
 (Walker(1964) via 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bowman2009"

\end_inset

).
 The proliferation of the instrument slowed as macroeconomic conditions
 eased, and criticism mounted.
 Unlike circuit breakers, homestead exemptions were poorly targeted and
 conferred arguably undue relief on relatively affluent individuals.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Fisher1996"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Homestead exemptions generally apply to owner-occupied housing.
 The vehicle for relief is a fixed portion of the property value.
 This portion can either be measured in a static dollar amount, or it can
 be structured as a percentage of home value.
 The choice among these two definitions carries significant implications
 for vertical equity.
 The former is more progressive because it does not permit an increase in
 the size of the benefit as a function of increasing home values (which
 are typically associated with higher incomes).
 This distinction also drives the political economy dynamic in the sense
 that those that reside in a jurisdiction that defines homestead exemptions
 as a percentage of home value are explicitly impacting the marginal cost
 of additional expenditure.
 Insofar as the prices is reduced by the homestead percentage, individuals
 will have a higher propensity to seek additional public services even as
 the exemption narrows the base.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Colorado, the homestead exemption currently stands at $60,000 for non-elderly
/disabled filers and $90,000 for the elderly/disabled subgroup of the population.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Preferential Classification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

In those states with a legal classification system, business property is
 assessed or taxed higher in proportion to value than residential or farm
 property.
 Within the business class, utility property is usually assesses or taxed
 higher than other business property.
 Clearly this reflects the reality of electoral and legislative politics.
 Every home and every farm is represented by one or more voters.
 Utility companies are far less represented in the electorate.

Fisher succinctly captures the essence of property tax relief, generally.
 Measures which benefit politically privileged or motivated classes tend
 to prevail.
 In the context of classification, this occurs via differential assessment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly the motivation behind classification is the direct benefit.
 To the extent that businesses shoulder a disproportionate share of the
 taxable base, residential property taxpayers are benefiting from public
 services at a discounted price.
 Gervais notes that the return to housing capital exceeds the return to
 business capital.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Gervais is actually studying the wedge caused by the failure to tax imputed
 rent and the mortgage interest deduction.
 however, preferential classification necessarily increases the size of
 said wedge, which generally implies underprovision of capital for businesses
 within the jurisdiction in question, which in turn implies lower commercial
 productivity.

 In particular, they evaluated the impact of classification in Cook County

 They found that higher commercial property tax rates 1) hampered the growth

This is, of course, the static assessment.
 The dynamic impact is far less clear.
 To the extent that commercial taxpayers can secure deferred or reduced
 tax liability in exchange for increased capital investment in the area,
 measuring the distribution of liability on balance is an empirical imperative.
 The bottom line is that artificial obstacles to equitable to equitable

Relief for Seniors

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps the single largest complaint about the homestead exemption is poor
 targeting.
 The relief provided simply does not focus on those who have a difficult
 time accommodating the property tax liabilities associated with their home.
 A partial response to this criticism has been manifested as a movement
 to provide relief specifically to low-income seniors.
\end_layout

The rationale for the low-income component is evident given the targeting
 criticism.
 The age component requires another critical contextual element.
 This movement began in the 1950s, a couple decades after the passage of
 Social Security.
 The country was accumulating evidence that this program was changing the
 prevalent life cycle sequence.
 In particular, Social Security was facilitating retirement for older Americans,
 albeit on limited income.

In the 1950s, a sharp drop occurre in labor force participation for men
 65 and older, as Social Security retirements affected labor force participation
 rates.
 [...] Another reason for the decline in men's labor force participation rates,
 mainly older men, is that pensions and disability awards became more available.
 The decrease in participation for men 65 and older was 29.3 percentage points
 over the 1950-80 period, with most of the decrease occurring in the 1950s.

This method of property tax relief was designed specifically for this group.
 Evidence of this motivation is apparent in the definition of income that

Truth-in-Taxation

\begin_layout Standard
Truth-in-taxation reforms were one of the less caustic responses to the
 environmental elements that led to the tax revolts of the 1970s.
 Among the most pressing concerns at the time was the rapid increase in
 housing values and the subsequent rise in assessment values.
 This enabled jurisdictions to increase property tax revenues without modificati
on of the tax rate, creating automatic increases in liabilities for homeowners
 who, in many cases, were not experiencing commensurate increases in income.

 They utilized a natural experiment in Kansas to conclude that, contrary
 to popular belief, truth-in-taxation was a more effective fiscal constraint
 than a general property tax levy limit.
 Per capita property taxes, own-source revenues, and own-source expenditures
 were all lower during the full disclosure regime relative to the period
 characterized by the explicit levy limit.
 These empirical results suggest that the impact of full disclosure is varied,
 but in any case they serve as a high value informational tool.
 The informational detail offered by such provisions cannot be matched by
 blanket rules that hold constant no matter what environmental circumstance

 Gold argues that there are two general classes of relief measures, those
 that are automatic and those that are induced.
 The former group seeks to correct what is perceived to be a standing issue,
 while the latter group may be characterized as a response to environmental
 conditions.
 While it may initially seem that these deferral programs would have been
 a result of the rising property values that catalyzed the so-called tax
 revolt, Gold argues that these programs are in fact automatic reforms seeking
 to mitigate cash flow problems due to property tax burdens.
 In particular, they are designed to assist seniors that may have benefited
 from home appreciation that far outstrips the growth in their incomes (particul
arly after retirement).
 These programs serve as a method to utilize the capital value accumulated
 in their home to handle their tax liability, albeit at subsidized rates.

It is axiomatic that the management of purely local affairs belongs to the

 The continued and permanent existence of local government is, therefore,
 assumed in all state constitutions, and is a matter of constitutional right,
 even when not in terms expressly provided for.
 It would not be competent to dispense it by statute.

Educational mandates are a product of a constitutional conflict over the
 appropriate method to finance education.
 Education is among the most costly expenditure responsibilities at the

 Consequently, it is unsurprising that such a large expenditure depends

 The problem arose in tying property wealth to the resources available to
 finance the education of children within the jurisdiction in question.
 Unsurprisingly, variation in real estate wealth is substantial, necessarily
 leading to wide variation in educational resources across jurisdictions.
