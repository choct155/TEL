 Tax Limitations - Voting, Colorado Ballot #1, 1992
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1992, by a vote of 812,308 to 700,906, Colorado voters chose to amend
 Section 20 of Article X of the Colorado State Constitution.
 The initiative is known as the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR), one of
 the most well-known tax and expenditure limitations (TELs) in the United
 States.
 A remarkable 43.3% of the total population

What is the Purpose of this Inquiry?
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sub:ResearchObjectives"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this study writ large is to explore the endogenous role of
 fiscal institutions in emergent fiscal outcomes.
 The class of institutions studied here, tax and expenditure limitations,
 act directly on fiscal outcomes by restricting the set of feasible choices
 for revenue generation and the allocation of public funds.
 These institutions, however, are generally enacted as a response to dissatisfac
tion with realized fiscal outcomes.
 It would be reasonable to push this point further: the magnitude of the
 restriction bears some relationship to extent of the dissatisfaction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such endogeneity is notoriously difficult to untangle, even when the scope
 of the phenomenon under study is restricted.
 In the case of tax and expenditure limitations, there are many moving parts.
 TELs typically have broad application, affecting jurisdictions with wide
 variation in socioeconomic circumstance and constituent preference.
 Each of these jurisdictions differs in its revenue portfolio, as well as
 the complexity and scope of its expenditure responsibilities.
 Furthermore, each of these subsystems is vulnerable to the whims of macro-level
 fluctuations in economic activity and legal structure.
 Analytic tractability requires a reduction in the data space, so that we
 may tie together a plausible model of the world.
 This reduction is necessary in any rigorous analysis, but endogeneity is
 not making the task any easier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason, we identify three broad objectives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Evaluate the impact of TELs on revenue yield and capacity;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Evaluate the extent to which TELs impact expenditure choices; and,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Explore whether or not TELs help to align voter preferences with fiscal
 outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is the Value Added?
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This kind of analysis is not novel in a broad sense.
 As we will see, there exists a formidable literature on TELs.
 There are two major elements that differentiate this study from those that
 have preceded it.
 First, rather than focus on a single policy (e.g.
 TABOR), this analysis models the joint impact of overlapping policies.
 The most novel element of this approach is abstraction away from the explicit
 program elements.
 Previous studies have often modeled the existence of TELs with binary indicator
s, or built an index score based upon factors like method of passage (statutory
 vs.
 constitutional), ease of override, and the magnitude of the growth ceiling
 among other things.
 Unless we believe that the impacts of TELs are additive, binary approaches
 lack the informational resolution to model the joint impacts of overlapping
 policies.
 Index methods, on the other hand, have a commensurability problem.
 Just because one TEL has a statutory authorization and another has a constituti
onal authorization, is the former fundamentally less restrictive than the
 latter in all cases? Even if we roll all elements of the index into the
 equation, does an override procedure have universal impact irrespective
 of the joint distribution of remaining TEL components? Both the binary
 and index approaches also suffer from lack of variation in the impact across
 jurisdictions.
 The restrictiveness of TELs, as we will see, is quite dependent upon the
 circumstances of the constrained jurisdiction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For all of these reasons, this study attacks the issue from a different
 perspective.
 To operationalize these policies, 
\emph on
the focus is shifted from program design to program impact
\emph default
.
 Instead of asking how a TEL was passed, for example, we ask what is the
 feasible levy given the existence of the policy? This approach rests on
 a constraint function that carries arguments for revenue impact and jurisdictio
n-specific characteristics.
 In so doing, it avoids implicit assumptions about commensurability, facilitates
 modeling of joint impact for multiple policies, and provides continuous
 variation across jurisdictions.
 Ultimately, the aforementioned deficiencies are hard to overcome, and indeed,
 this study makes an imperfect attempt.
 We will still have to make some assumptions that are less than desirable.
 However, the philosophy followed here suggests that more is knowable about
 the impact of TELs on specific jurisdictions, and we should use that informatio
n to the extent possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second major innovation in the world TEL research is the explicit acknowledg
ement of spatial dependency.
 No jurisdiction operates in a vacuum.
 By virtue of the fact that this study evaluates the impact of state-enacted
 policies on local governments, the very design suggests that vertical relations
hips across governmental entities matter.
 Horizontal relationships are also important components of the system.
 As it turns out, externalities are real.
 The impact of one jurisdiction influences, and is influenced by, the actions
 of jurisdictions in the local neighborhood.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The local neighborhood represents jurisdictions that are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the jurisdiction in question.
 What it means to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 varies by analytic objective.
 For our purposes, we use local neighborhood to mean the jurisdictions that
 are spatially proximate.
 For a different purpose, one might alternatively define 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to be similarity in industrial base, or demographic composition, or some
 other variable set of interest.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In a manner quite similar to omission of temporal dependency, omitting
 spatial dependency can lead to false signals.
 Does a given jurisdiction respond to the TEL constraint as the spatially-static
 model suggests, or is the measured response a function of the actions of
 neighbors? The smaller the jurisdiction, the greater the influence of overlappi
ng populations, commercial activity, and shared resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether or not these innovations change the picture painted by previous
 literature, they seek to account for potentially confounding elements in
 the measurement space.
 In so doing, agreement would serve only to bolster the robustness of earlier
 findings.
 More importantly, however, these approaches (of which this study provides
 only a test drive) open the door for a wider scope of inquiry than was
 available with the binary and index approaches.
 In particular, the incorporation of jurisdictional variation in impact
 helps local policymakers to better understand policy implications for their
 own specific circumstance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is the Spatial Scope of Analysis?
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:SpatialScope"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The geographic scope of this study is the State of Colorado.
 It was chosen because it features what is widely regarded as one of the
 most restrictive TEL regimes in the United States.
 TABOR, specifically, is often mentioned in the same breath as California's
 Proposition 13 and Massachusetts' Proposition 2
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$
\backslash
frac{1}{2}$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 when describing what a restrictive regime looks like.
 That being said, TABOR is just one piece of the puzzle.
 The TEL landscape also includes the Gallagher Amendment (GA) and the Statewide
 Limitation on Property Tax Revenue (SLPTR), two additional restrictions
 that act upon local governments.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Colorado features additional restrictions like Amendment 23 and policies
 acting on the state level.
 This analysis, thus, represents only a partial representation of the entire
 landscape.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 All three of these policies have significant implications for the property
 tax, which is the dominant element of own-source revenue for local governments
 in the state.
 As a consequence of this intersection, the impact on property tax revenue
 is the dominant focus for operationalizing the impact of these policies.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
So enters an implicit assumption that is less than ideal.
 TABOR actually has broader revenue scope than SLPTR and GA, but the constructio
n of the composite constraint used in the empirical modeling requires a
 common object upon which the policies can act.
 The property tax serves that role, and therefore acts as a proxy in the
 TABOR case for the dynamics associated with the broader revenue portfolio.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Counties serve as the unit of analysis for a number of reasons.
 First, general purpose jurisdictions are convenient insofar as they feature
 greater variety in service responsibilities.
 To understand the impact of TELs on expenditure behavior (the second research
 objective), this variation will prove useful because it facilitates identificat
ion of differential impacts from TELs.
 Suppose an extreme case in which we have classified expenditure behavior
 into only high and low expenditure categories.
 We may be able to extract a good sense of the likelihood of a TEL pushing
 a jurisdiction into one category or the other, but determining the precise
 magnitude of the shift is less straightforward.
 Increasing the number of categories or switching to interval expenditure
 data
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Switching from categorical to interval data is effectively equivalent to
 increasing the number of categories,

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 helps us answer that question.
 Splitting the expenditure into more functions refines our understanding
 even better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, counties are favored over municipalities for reasons of spatial
 parsimony.
 There are 62 counties in Colorado, and two consolidated city-county governments
 (Denver and Broomfield).
 For the purposes of this study, Denver and Broomfield are also treated
 as counties.
 This choice reflects the fact that Denver and Broomfield
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Broomfield County was created
 from parts of Adams, Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld counties effective November
 15, 2001.
 Estimates from BEA for Broomfield began in 2002.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 do not overlap, nor are they overlapped by, the conventional counties in
 the state.
 Moreover, this collection of 64 jurisdictions represents a spatially-exhaustive
 set of jurisdictional units.
 Municipalities do not feature these properties, nor do they consistently
 nest within counties.
 Thus, the use of municipalities would complicate the analysis substantially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third reason, and perhaps the most important, relates to the allocation
 of levy responsibility for the property tax.
 As we will see, property taxes are the dominant form of own-source revenue.
 Counties generally collect a greater share of property taxes relative to
 the other major general purpose jurisdictional form: municipalities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, counties are also analytically convenient from a data availability
 standpoint.
 Data is collected extensively at the county-level by both state and federal
 statistical authorities.
 At the state level, the information used in this study is collected by
 the Colorado State Division of Local Affairs.
 They provide excellent, standardized fiscal information and limited demographic
 information over the study window.
 The federal sources (predominately the US Census Bureau) do not feature
 the same reporting frequency in some cases, but the set of socioeconomic
 variables is much greater than that which is collected by the state.

This study examines the fiscal response of counties to TELs over the 1993-2009
 time period.
 The start date reflects the first year in which all three TELs of interest
 (TABOR, GA, and SLPTR) acted upon the counties in Colorado.
 The end date, by contrast, reflects a less conceptually relevant rationale.
 At the start of the this inquiry, the latest available data in the Colorado
 County and Municipal Financial Compendium was for 2009.

 The national and state governments account for only 51 of these entities.
 Aside from a handful of territories, the remaining entities constitute
 the remarkably diverse local government sector.
 In broad terms, to borrow the Census classification, these governmental
 units are split into five classes: counties, municipalities, townships,
 school districts and special districts.
 These local governments vary in population size and composition, resource
 endowment, geographic scope, corporate purpose, and the nature by which
 they interact with vertical and horizontal counterparts.

In his treatise, 
\emph on
The Theory of Public Finaince 
\emph default
(
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Musgrave59"

\end_inset

), Professor Musgrave constructed a framework for conceptualizing public
 finance in a federal system that has proven robust to a remarkably varied
 set of research inquiries.
 This framework once again proves useful in explaining the significance
 of subnational finance in the US.
 Musgrave's approach defines three primary tasks for the public sector in
 an economy, and allocates those functions to the appropriate level of governmen
t.
 For the purposes of this analysis, the front end of the framework (function
 definition) proves directly applicable while some modification of the back
 end (allocation of functions) may be needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Musgrave, there are three primary roles for the public sector:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Direct service delivery (i.e.
 allocation);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Redistribution of resources; and,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Macroeconomic stabilization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first (allocation) is the direct product of government operation, the
 most direct link to taxes paid.
 The second (redistribution) seeks to adjust resource allocations to accord
 with societal preferences for distributional equity.
 An additional motivation for this function can be the mitigation of damages
 that have occured due to trade.
 Insofar as the cost-benefit calculation from a trade is typically considered
 beneficial whether or not the gains help to offset the losses experienced
 by ill-placed parties 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hicks39,Kaldor39"

\end_inset

, losses are free to occur by construction.
 The third function (stabilization) seeks to maintain an environment conducive
 to achieving the full potential of economic output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it turns out, these three functions cannot be cleanly assigned to the
 three levels of government (federal, state, and local).
 Indeed, comparatively recent literature 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bahl1984,Gramlich1993"

\end_inset

 suggests that the discord is even greater than Musgrave had originally
 believed.
 In any event, there is broad agreement that the preponderance of direct
 service provision occurs at the level closest to the recipients of services:
 local.
 Indeed, this de facto postulate is the supporting force behind Oates' Decentral
ization Theorem

It should be noted that Professor Oates would argue, and has argued (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

), that Tiebout sorting is not a prerequisite for the Decentralization Theorem.
 Mobility is not required for the latter to have an effect.
 I would argue, however, that even if unnecessary, Tiebout sorting improves
 the efficacy of the Decentralization Theorem in the sense that mobility
 increases the systemic capacity to match supply and demand in the local
 taxation-expenditure bundle market.

For a public good - the consumption of which defined over geographical subsets
 of the total population, and for which the costs of providing each level
 of the good are the same for the central or for the respective local government
 - it will always be more efficient (or at least as efficient) for local
 governments to provide Pareto-efficient levels of output for their respective
 jurisdictions than for the central government to provide any specified
 and uniform level of output across all jurisdictions.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perusal of budgets across the three levels of government (national, state,
 and local) will affirm that direct service provision constitutes larger
 portions of the budget the closer one gets to the citizens.
 This is a good thing because the capacity to choose among local menus is
 welfare enhancing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Direct service provision serves as the nexus at which the taxpayer realizes
 the connection between tax price and the return from that investment.
 Indeeed, this intuitive dictum accords with an argument that substantially
 predates Musgraves' revelation.
 The nascent stages of our republic were characterized by fierce deliberation
 over the capacity to govern such a geographically expansive jurisdiction.
 The concern raised by so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Anti-Federalists
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 was the idea that it was simply not possible to govern a space of this
 size because representatives could not feasibly identify with the populations
 they were elected to represent.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Storing1981"

\end_inset

 Again, the issue was contact.
 Supporting direct service delivery (a role that is critical not only to
 public finance, but also democracy) requires a vehicle by which said activities
 can propagate.
 That is, the resources to deliver these services must be reliably generated
 from a viable and stable revenue source.

 It is this variety that provides a vehicle for demand articulation within
 the public sphere.
 Insofar as taxpayers are free to choose among a set of taxation-expenditure
 bundles, the system intrinsically seeks to minimize the deadweight loss
 associated with coerced conformity.
 Tiebout sorting requires some unrealistic assumptions in perfect information
 and costless mobility, but there does appear to be empirical support for
 the occurrence of sorting.

While this does look promising, Ross and Yinger note that homogeneity as

 results are also consistent with the consensus bidding framework.

Having established the operational handles of an abstract local tax, the
 choice of specific taxes should strive to capture the ideal elements of
 a local tax: immobility, adequacy/buoyancy, stabilty/predictability, fairness,
 administrative ease, non-exportality, and visibility (i.e.
 transparency).
 For the most part, these characteristics are goals for any tax at any level.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that these are theoretical objectives for tax design, identified for
 the purpose of maintaining a tight coupling between revenue generation
 and expenditure allocation.
 Such a coupling seeks to create a tight response for taxpayers, so that
 they may link the costs they feel from taxes with the benefits of service
 delivery in a manner that minimizes noise from other factors.
 The stronger this linkage, the greater the capacity for taxpayers to equalize
 costs and benefits at the margin.
 In practice, however, political expediency has an outsized role in the
 selection of available revenue handles, and can distort the role of other
 characteristics.
 For example, from a political perspective, exportability becomes an asset
 for those promoting a given tax.

 (and subsequently supported by Bird, Gramlich, and others), the idea of
 open and closed jurisdictions plays a prominent role.
 Closed jurisdictions are characterized by sufficiently high exit costs
 as to discourage departure from the jurisdiction over a wide range of tax
 prices.
 While the national government may feature this property, local governments
 do not.
 Local governments must contend with open borders, also known as low costs
 of exit.
 It is for this reason that a graduated income tax with comparable progressivity
 to the national model does not exist at the subnational level.
 Local officials are worried that taxpayers may simply choose to reside
 somewhere else.
 In this light, the fixed nature of real property makes it an attractive
 base upon which to levy a local tax.

This macro-level environment has direct and indirect consequences for local
 fiscal managers.
 The first direct impact involves increased expenditure exposure in functions
 related to emergency services and any funding for senior care.
 The second direct impact reduces receipts by way of senior-related tax
 non-neutralities (e.g.
 property tax credits for seniors).
 Indirect impacts are driven by increased expenditure risk for governments
 at the state and federal level.
 To the extent that the administration of these programs reduces the available

 The immobility of the property tax base, for instance, derives much of
 its value from the decision of economic actors to site themselves within
 the jurisdiction in question.
 To the extent that economic coordination requires spatially proximate associati

 leverage this siting choice.
 Even if the country as a whole experienced no net loss in population, those
 local jurisdictions with comparatively high revenue requirements stand
 to lose a great deal.
 Beyond that, siting within the US in general is not quite as necessary

Economic activity, as used here, captures both the value generated from

 Such a market is also likely to see increases in the value of the housing

 Both are functions of underlying demand, which would be depressed in a

 The downside of thei development is a strong dependency by local governments

 When the economy enters a recession, while the impacts on own source revenue

Lack of Uniformity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tax is not actually an ad valorem tax in the sense that it is not levied
 on a fixed percentage of property value.
 Instead, the assessment ratio and/or tax rate are calculated in a way that
 takes the taxing jurisdiction's desired total levy as a primary argument.
 This construct creates the capacity for significant variation in burdens
 across jurisdictions, due to the variations in fiscal requirements.
 The result is horizontal inequity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Lack of Universality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite numerous historical attempts to create a general purpose tax (which
 Seligman discusses in some detail), the practical problem of capturing
 personal property in a way that is commensurate with levies on real property
 creates disparities in burden that are driven by occupational genre rather
 than ability to pay or benefits received.
 These practical problems are a function of both political manipulation
 and the difficulty in getting a handle on intangible/administratively inconveni
ent personal property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Incentive for Dishonesty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When entire classes of property are exempt from taxation, Seligman correctly
 argues that avoidance incentives are high.
 The rational taxpayer will shift assets to protected classes whenever possible.
 In many cases, such practices have exerted pressure on, or entirely breached,
 the boundary between avoidance and evasion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Regressivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seligman's context for this complaint involved his observance of the transition
 away from the agrarian social context that characterized the early period
 in US history.
 In particular, famers were disadvantaged in the practical taxation of property
 because their assets were quite intangible and visible.
 In contrast, holdings derived from trade often enjoyed tax exempted status,
 either de facto or de jure, as a consequence of their intractability as
 administratively feasible tax handles.
 Since trading wealth often exceeded that which was derived from agriculture,
 this feature was a regressive one.
 This framework holds today in the sense that personal property can drive
 a tremendous wedge in aggregate asset holdings across homeowners.
 To the extent that personal property is taxes inconsistently at best, Seligman'
s concerns are still valid.

Property is taxed in practice based upon the value of the asset,

 the social context that permitted such reforms to take place.
 As discussed in Section

 constructive reform in practice.
 In the real world, however, students of public finance are all to rare.

Thus, while we can advance the economic critique of reform movements and

political economy approach to fiscal federalism.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 It differs from the fiscal federalism approach that Oates advanced in 1972,
 largely due to differing evaluations of two key assumptions.
 First, traditional fiscal federalism assumes that officials seek to maximize
 the welfare of the jurisdiction they serve.
 This pursuit leads naturally to strong welfare gains as a consequence of
 local variation, leading to tax-expenditure bundles that can be better
 tailored to local conditions.
 The political economy approach makes no such assumption, leaving room for
 political calculation that may be out of phase with actual maximization
 of constituent welfare.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Perrson_Tabellini2000,Besley_Case1995"

\end_inset

 Second, the political economy literature does not assume, as traditional
 fiscal federalism does, that central provision implies uniform public output.
 Variations in output can and do arise from the legislative process and
 the insertion of non-neutralities.
 These non-neutralities typically arise as a consequence of the variety
 of political power endowments and cultivation efforts across local jurisdiction
s.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 I would extend this further to remark that, in the context of varying local
 conditions, the effect of non-neutralities is far from clear cut.
 Moreover, variance in local implementation carries its own additional source
 of variance in public outputs.

 Although the institutional reforms have limited the efficacy of the property

 If these reforms prolong the use of the property tax, then a tool of fiscal

 Indeed, the third empirical section in this study scratches the surface

One of the challenges in researching relief mechanisms is the establishment

 The variety in implementation that occurs for these relief mechanisms creates
 an environment in which considerable grey areas arise in classification.
 Bowman notes that these arise because all property tax relief measures
 necessarily act on one of three things: the tax base, the tax rate, or
 the income of the taxpayer.

 For this reason, this section will use Bowman's definition of circuit breakers.

 To the extent that a voter already owes the maximum allowable percentage

 cost.
 On the other hand, circuit breakers directly decrease the property tax
 base, thereby potentially increasing liabilities for everyone else.
 Consequently, this instrument does particularly well to stoke tensions
 in the politicial space (voters abover the threshold versus voters below
 the threshold) that serve as an instrinsic characteristic of public finance.

Homestead Exemptions

The homestead exemption was a product of the housing issues experienced

 portion of property value.

 The proliferation of the instrument slowed as macroeconomic conditions

Homestead exemptions generally apply to owner-occupied housing.
 The vehicle for relief is a fixed portion of the property value.
 This portion can either be measured in a static dollar amount, or it can
 be structured as a percentage of home value.
 The choice among these two definitions carries significant implications
 for vertical equity.
 The former is more progressive because it does not permit an increase in
 the size of the benefit as a function of increasing home values (which
 are typically associated with higher incomes).
 This distinction also drives the political economy dynamic in the sense
 that those that reside in a jurisdiction that defines homestead exemptions
 as a percentage of home value are explicitly impacting the marginal cost
 of additional expenditure.
 Insofar as the prices is reduced by the homestead percentage, individuals
 will have a higher propensity to seek additional public services even as
 the exemption narrows the base.

 than a general property tax levy limit.
 Per capita property taxes, own-source revenues, and own-source expenditures
 were all lower during the full disclosure regime relative to the period
 characterized by the explicit levy limit.

 Gold argues that there are two general classes of relief measures, those
 that are automatic and those that are induced.
 The former group seeks to correct what is perceived to be a standing issue,
 while the latter group may be characterized as a response to environmental
 conditions.
 While it may initially seem that these deferral programs would have been
 a result of the rising property values that catalyzed the so-called tax
 revolt, Gold argues that these programs are in fact automatic reforms seeking
 to mitigate cash flow problems due to property tax burdens.
 In particular, they are designed to assist seniors that may have benefited
 from home appreciation that far outstrips the growth in their incomes (particul
arly after retirement).
 These programs serve as a method to utilize the capital value accumulated
 in their home to handle their tax liability, albeit at subsidized rates.

It is axiomatic that the management of purely local affairs belongs to the
 people concerned, not only because of being their own affairs, but because
 they will best understand, and be most competent to manage them.
 The continued and permanent existence of local government is, therefore,
 assumed in all state constitutions, and is a matter of constitutional right,
 even when not in terms expressly provided for.
 It would not be competent to dispense it by statute.
 [...] Nevertheless there is no constitutional form or model of local government,

Educational mandates are a product of a constitutional conflict over the
 appropriate method to finance education.
 Education is among the most costly expenditure responsibilities at the
 local level.
 Consequently, it is unsurprising that such a large expenditure depends
 heavily on the property tax.
 The problem arose in tying property wealth to the resources available to
 finance the education of children within the jurisdiction in question.
 Unsurprisingly, variation in real estate wealth is substantial, necessarily
 leading to wide variation in educational resources across jurisdictions.

Tax and expenditure limitations, or TELs, are direct attempts to limit the

 The vehicle for this limitation is an explicit constraint on one of three
 targets: the tax rate, the assessment base, or the entire levy.

It is all too common for these devices to be used in tandem.
 A perfect example would be California's Proposition 13, which has oft been
 cited as the beginning of the most recent TEL movement.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Within two years of the passage of Proposition 13, 43 states had also implement

 income tax rates, and 10 states indexed their income taxes to the rate
 of inflation.

\begin_layout Standard
Admittedly, Proposition 13 was a particularly aggressive limitation effort.
 It does serve, however, to demonstrate the types of impacts that can occur
 with these reforms.
 Such effects do not occur everywhere, particularly when reforms are not
 of the binding variety defined by Mullins and Joyce.
 Binding limitations provide no workaround to achieve the same revenue targets.
 A two-part composite reform created this environment in California.
 Passed on June 2, 1978, Proposition 13 limited assessment increases to
 2% annually and mandated a rate ceiling of 1%.
 Rather than address the revenue yield directly, voters chose to limit the
 base and rate inputs.
 Furthermore, assessed values reverted back to 1976 levels.
 Couple this reduction in the base with the practice of acquisition value
 assessement, in which real estate values only reflect the market value
 at the time of sale, and one gets a potent mix for revenue reduction.

The effect was dramatic.
 Property tax revenue immediately fell by 57 percent across the state.
 Local governments in California collected over $6.6 billion less in property
 tax revenue in 1979 than they did in 1978 (Citrin 1984).
 California property taxes went from 51 percent above the national average
 in 1978 to 22 percent below the average in 1981.

Which Revenue Sources are Employed?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a revenue perspective, in real terms, Colorado has experienced consistent
 growth over the 1975-2009 time period.
 Overall, county revenue increased by 72% over the period on average (from
 $1,013 to $1,741).
 These measures of central tendency, however, mask considerable variation
 in the individual trajectories of specific counties.
 The average range of per capita revenue was $3,772 over the same period.
 Note also that the median revenue per capita increase (63%) did not significant
ly lag the mean increase, suggesting a relatively stable distribution of
 county revenue across time.

Somewhat surprisingly, the growth in tax receipts (+187%) over the period
 outpaced growth in intergovernmental transfers (+42%).
 As Mullins and Joyce have noted, there has been a general increase in local
 dependency on higher level transfers in addition to dependency on fees
 and charges associated with the imposition of strong TELs.

key "Joyce_Mullins1991"

\end_inset

 In fairness, however, the target of these TELs is usually the property
 tax.
 While the property tax has grown in terms of receipts (+168%), it has fallen
 as a percentage of total tax revenue (-6.5%).
 Moreover, the growth in sales revenue as a percentage of all tax revenues
 has increased dramatically (+30%).
 It has also stood out as the fastest growing revenue source (+273%).
 Although it remains a small portion of the overall portfolio, license revenu
 grew faster than all other sources (+489%), followed by revenue from charges
 (+406%).
 This growth is consistent with the expected impacts of TEL policies.

Which Expenditure Responsibilities Exist?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the expenditure side, both growth in average (+65%) and median (+61%)
 liabilities per capita has remarkably lagged growth in revenues over the
 1975-2009 period (Figure

 As with the revenue trajectories, median expenditures mirror average expenditur

While debt service has been the fastest growing liability for counties in
 Colorado (+633%), it still remains a small portion of the overall budget
 (4.7% in 2009).
 The dominant liability resides with operating expenditures.
 Given the preponderence of direct spending activity at the local level,
 this is unsurprising.
 Operating expenditures increased 116% over the period, but fell as a percentage
 of total expenditures (79% to 76%).
 Within operating expenditures, the fastest growing line item was judicial
 expenditure (+263%), although it constituted only 3.6% of operating expenditures
 in 2009.
 The real story is in public safety, which grew 231% over the period.
 This spending increased its compositional importance notably, growing from
 19% to 29% of operating expenditures and 15% to 22% of total expenditures.

As noted in the beginning of this study, the TABOR amendment was passed
 in 1992.
 TABOR is by far the most well known of the Colorado TELs, but in fact,
 the history of TELs in Colorado started much earlier.
 What follows is a timeline of major TEL initiatives in Colorado:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
1991: The statutory state-level General Fund appropriation limit (a.k.a the
 Arveshoug-Bird Limit) caps growth at the lesser of either 5% of growth
 in statewide income, or 6% growth over the previous year's appropriation
 level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While multiple limits act at the state level, our focus for this analysis
 is local revenue behavior.
 In particular, we are concerned with the property tax which has stood out
 over time as the most important revenue source for local governments.
 For this reason, we will further unpack the three most significant reforms
 in this are a bit further: TABOR, SLPTR, and GA.
