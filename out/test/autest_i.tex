% IMPORTANT NOTES:
% 1) You MUST run LaTeX THREE times after runing BibTeX.
% 2) Make sure that you have the LATEST version of the AUTHESIS class files
%    before you hand in the final version of your thesis or dissertation.

% \usepackage commands should go before the \begin{document}

%\usepackage{ctable} %You should learn about ctable!!

% IF you use the 'cas' option instead of the preferred 'econ' option,
% you MAY uncomment the following line.  (NOT recommended.)
%\usepackage{ulem}

\usepackage{natbib}  % natbib citation style

% LONGTABLE
% To use longtable, add the following code to your preamble.
% Long table captions are single-spaced, but AU requires a
% double space between captions, so add to the pre-amble
% this redefinition (below) of the LT caption to your document.
% Also, attend to the order the captions are listed in the List of Tables.}
