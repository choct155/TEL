 Tax Limitations - Voting, Colorado Ballot #1, 1992
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1992, by a vote of 812,308 to 700,906, Colorado voters chose to amend
 Section 20 of Article X of the Colorado State Constitution.
 The initiative is known as the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR), one of
 the most well-known tax and expenditure limitations (TELs) in the United
 States.
 A remarkable 43.3% of the total population

What is the Purpose of this Inquiry?
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sub:ResearchObjectives"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this study writ large is to explore the endogenous role of
 fiscal institutions in emergent fiscal outcomes.
 The class of institutions studied here, tax and expenditure limitations,
 act directly on fiscal outcomes by restricting the set of feasible choices
 for revenue generation and the allocation of public funds.
 These institutions, however, are generally enacted as a response to dissatisfac
tion with realized fiscal outcomes.
 It would be reasonable to push this point further: the magnitude of the
 restriction bears some relationship to extent of the dissatisfaction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such endogeneity is notoriously difficult to untangle, even when the scope
 of the phenomenon under study is restricted.
 In the case of tax and expenditure limitations, there are many moving parts.
 TELs typically have broad application, affecting jurisdictions with wide
 variation in socioeconomic circumstance and constituent preference.
 Each of these jurisdictions differs in its revenue portfolio, as well as
 the complexity and scope of its expenditure responsibilities.
 Furthermore, each of these subsystems is vulnerable to the whims of macro-level
 fluctuations in economic activity and legal structure.
 Analytic tractability requires a reduction in the data space, so that we
 may tie together a plausible model of the world.
 This reduction is necessary in any rigorous analysis, but endogeneity is
 not making the task any easier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason, we identify three broad objectives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Evaluate the impact of TELs on revenue yield and capacity;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Evaluate the extent to which TELs impact expenditure choices; and,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Explore whether or not TELs help to align voter preferences with fiscal
 outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is the Value Added?
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This kind of analysis is not novel in a broad sense.
 As we will see, there exists a formidable literature on TELs.
 There are two major elements that differentiate this study from those that
 have preceded it.
 First, rather than focus on a single policy (e.g.
 TABOR), this analysis models the joint impact of overlapping policies.
 The most novel element of this approach is abstraction away from the explicit
 program elements.
 Previous studies have often modeled the existence of TELs with binary indicator
s, or built an index score based upon factors like method of passage (statutory
 vs.
 constitutional), ease of override, and the magnitude of the growth ceiling
 among other things.
 Unless we believe that the impacts of TELs are additive, binary approaches
 lack the informational resolution to model the joint impacts of overlapping
 policies.
 Index methods, on the other hand, have a commensurability problem.
 Just because one TEL has a statutory authorization and another has a constituti
onal authorization, is the former fundamentally less restrictive than the
 latter in all cases? Even if we roll all elements of the index into the
 equation, does an override procedure have universal impact irrespective
 of the joint distribution of remaining TEL components? Both the binary
 and index approaches also suffer from lack of variation in the impact across
 jurisdictions.
 The restrictiveness of TELs, as we will see, is quite dependent upon the
 circumstances of the constrained jurisdiction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For all of these reasons, this study attacks the issue from a different
 perspective.
 To operationalize these policies, 
\emph on
the focus is shifted from program design to program impact
\emph default
.
 Instead of asking how a TEL was passed, for example, we ask what is the
 feasible levy given the existence of the policy? This approach rests on
 a constraint function that carries arguments for revenue impact and jurisdictio
n-specific characteristics.
 In so doing, it avoids implicit assumptions about commensurability, facilitates
 modeling of joint impact for multiple policies, and provides continuous
 variation across jurisdictions.
 Ultimately, the aforementioned deficiencies are hard to overcome, and indeed,
 this study makes an imperfect attempt.
 We will still have to make some assumptions that are less than desirable.
 However, the philosophy followed here suggests that more is knowable about
 the impact of TELs on specific jurisdictions, and we should use that informatio
n to the extent possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second major innovation in the world TEL research is the explicit acknowledg
ement of spatial dependency.
 No jurisdiction operates in a vacuum.
 By virtue of the fact that this study evaluates the impact of state-enacted
 policies on local governments, the very design suggests that vertical relations
hips across governmental entities matter.
 Horizontal relationships are also important components of the system.
 As it turns out, externalities are real.
 The impact of one jurisdiction influences, and is influenced by, the actions
 of jurisdictions in the local neighborhood.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The local neighborhood represents jurisdictions that are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

close
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the jurisdiction in question.
 What it means to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 varies by analytic objective.
 For our purposes, we use local neighborhood to mean the jurisdictions that
 are spatially proximate.
 For a different purpose, one might alternatively define 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to be similarity in industrial base, or demographic composition, or some
 other variable set of interest.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In a manner quite similar to omission of temporal dependency, omitting
 spatial dependency can lead to false signals.
 Does a given jurisdiction respond to the TEL constraint as the spatially-static
 model suggests, or is the measured response a function of the actions of
 neighbors? The smaller the jurisdiction, the greater the influence of overlappi
ng populations, commercial activity, and shared resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether or not these innovations change the picture painted by previous
 literature, they seek to account for potentially confounding elements in
 the measurement space.
 In so doing, agreement would serve only to bolster the robustness of earlier
 findings.
 More importantly, however, these approaches (of which this study provides
 only a test drive) open the door for a wider scope of inquiry than was
 available with the binary and index approaches.
 In particular, the incorporation of jurisdictional variation in impact
 helps local policymakers to better understand policy implications for their
 own specific circumstance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is the Spatial Scope of Analysis?
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:SpatialScope"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The geographic scope of this study is the State of Colorado.
 It was chosen because it features what is widely regarded as one of the
 most restrictive TEL regimes in the United States.
 TABOR, specifically, is often mentioned in the same breath as California's
 Proposition 13 and Massachusetts' Proposition 2
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$
\backslash
frac{1}{2}$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 when describing what a restrictive regime looks like.
 That being said, TABOR is just one piece of the puzzle.
 The TEL landscape also includes the Gallagher Amendment (GA) and the Statewide
 Limitation on Property Tax Revenue (SLPTR), two additional restrictions
 that act upon local governments.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Colorado features additional restrictions like Amendment 23 and policies
 acting on the state level.
 This analysis, thus, represents only a partial representation of the entire
 landscape.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 All three of these policies have significant implications for the property
 tax, which is the dominant element of own-source revenue for local governments
 in the state.
 As a consequence of this intersection, the impact on property tax revenue
 is the dominant focus for operationalizing the impact of these policies.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
So enters an implicit assumption that is less than ideal.
 TABOR actually has broader revenue scope than SLPTR and GA, but the constructio
n of the composite constraint used in the empirical modeling requires a
 common object upon which the policies can act.
 The property tax serves that role, and therefore acts as a proxy in the
 TABOR case for the dynamics associated with the broader revenue portfolio.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Counties serve as the unit of analysis for a number of reasons.
 First, general purpose jurisdictions are convenient insofar as they feature
 greater variety in service responsibilities.
 To understand the impact of TELs on expenditure behavior (the second research
 objective), this variation will prove useful because it facilitates identificat
ion of differential impacts from TELs.
 Suppose an extreme case in which we have classified expenditure behavior
 into only high and low expenditure categories.
 We may be able to extract a good sense of the likelihood of a TEL pushing
 a jurisdiction into one category or the other, but determining the precise
 magnitude of the shift is less straightforward.
 Increasing the number of categories or switching to interval expenditure
 data
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Switching from categorical to interval data is effectively equivalent to
 increasing the number of categories,

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 helps us answer that question.
 Splitting the expenditure into more functions refines our understanding
 even better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, counties are favored over municipalities for reasons of spatial
 parsimony.
 There are 62 counties in Colorado, and two consolidated city-county governments
 (Denver and Broomfield).
 For the purposes of this study, Denver and Broomfield are also treated
 as counties.
 This choice reflects the fact that Denver and Broomfield
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Broomfield County was created
 from parts of Adams, Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld counties effective November
 15, 2001.
 Estimates from BEA for Broomfield began in 2002.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 do not overlap, nor are they overlapped by, the conventional counties in
 the state.
 Moreover, this collection of 64 jurisdictions represents a spatially-exhaustive
 set of jurisdictional units.
 Municipalities do not feature these properties, nor do they consistently
 nest within counties.
 Thus, the use of municipalities would complicate the analysis substantially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third reason, and perhaps the most important, relates to the allocation
 of levy responsibility for the property tax.
 As we will see, property taxes are the dominant form of own-source revenue.
 Counties generally collect a greater share of property taxes relative to
 the other major general purpose jurisdictional form: municipalities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, counties are also analytically convenient from a data availability
 standpoint.
 Data is collected extensively at the county-level by both state and federal
 statistical authorities.
 At the state level, the information used in this study is collected by
 the Colorado State Division of Local Affairs.
 They provide excellent, standardized fiscal information and limited demographic
 information over the study window.
 The federal sources (predominately the US Census Bureau) do not feature
 the same reporting frequency in some cases, but the set of socioeconomic
 variables is much greater than that which is collected by the state.

This study examines the fiscal response of counties to TELs over the 1993-2009
 time period.
 The start date reflects the first year in which all three TELs of interest
 (TABOR, GA, and SLPTR) acted upon the counties in Colorado.
 The end date, by contrast, reflects a less conceptually relevant rationale.
 At the start of the this inquiry, the latest available data in the Colorado
 County and Municipal Financial Compendium was for 2009.

 The national and state governments account for only 51 of these entities.

 In broad terms, to borrow the Census classification, these governmental

 school districts and special districts.
 These local governments vary in population size and composition, resource
 endowment, geographic scope, corporate purpose, and the nature by which
 they interact with vertical and horizontal counterparts.

In his treatise, 
\emph on
The Theory of Public Finaince 
\emph default
(
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Musgrave59"

\end_inset

), Professor Musgrave constructed a framework for conceptualizing public
 finance in a federal system that has proven robust to a remarkably varied
 set of research inquiries.
 This framework once again proves useful in explaining the significance
 of subnational finance in the US.
 Musgrave's approach defines three primary tasks for the public sector in
 an economy, and allocates those functions to the appropriate level of governmen
t.
 For the purposes of this analysis, the front end of the framework (function
 definition) proves directly applicable while some modification of the back
 end (allocation of functions) may be needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Musgrave, there are three primary roles for the public sector:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Direct service delivery (i.e.
 allocation);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Redistribution of resources; and,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Macroeconomic stabilization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first (allocation) is the direct product of government operation, the
 most direct link to taxes paid.
 The second (redistribution) seeks to adjust resource allocations to accord
 with societal preferences for distributional equity.
 An additional motivation for this function can be the mitigation of damages
 that have occured due to trade.
 Insofar as the cost-benefit calculation from a trade is typically considered
 beneficial whether or not the gains help to offset the losses experienced
 by ill-placed parties 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hicks39,Kaldor39"

\end_inset

, losses are free to occur by construction.
 The third function (stabilization) seeks to maintain an environment conducive
 to achieving the full potential of economic output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it turns out, these three functions cannot be cleanly assigned to the
 three levels of government (federal, state, and local).
 Indeed, comparatively recent literature 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bahl1984,Gramlich1993"

\end_inset

 suggests that the discord is even greater than Musgrave had originally
 believed.
 In any event, there is broad agreement that the preponderance of direct
 service provision occurs at the level closest to the recipients of services:
 local.
 Indeed, this de facto postulate is the supporting force behind Oates' Decentral
ization Theorem

It should be noted that Professor Oates would argue, and has argued (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

), that Tiebout sorting is not a prerequisite for the Decentralization Theorem.
 Mobility is not required for the latter to have an effect.
 I would argue, however, that even if unnecessary, Tiebout sorting improves
 the efficacy of the Decentralization Theorem in the sense that mobility
 increases the systemic capacity to match supply and demand in the local
 taxation-expenditure bundle market.

For a public good - the consumption of which defined over geographical subsets
 of the total population, and for which the costs of providing each level
 of the good are the same for the central or for the respective local government
 - it will always be more efficient (or at least as efficient) for local
 governments to provide Pareto-efficient levels of output for their respective
 jurisdictions than for the central government to provide any specified
 and uniform level of output across all jurisdictions.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perusal of budgets across the three levels of government (national, state,
 and local) will affirm that direct service provision constitutes larger
 portions of the budget the closer one gets to the citizens.
 This is a good thing because the capacity to choose among local menus is
 welfare enhancing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Direct service provision serves as the nexus at which the taxpayer realizes
 the connection between tax price and the return from that investment.
 Indeeed, this intuitive dictum accords with an argument that substantially
 predates Musgraves' revelation.
 The nascent stages of our republic were characterized by fierce deliberation
 over the capacity to govern such a geographically expansive jurisdiction.
 The concern raised by so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Anti-Federalists
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 was the idea that it was simply not possible to govern a space of this
 size because representatives could not feasibly identify with the populations
 they were elected to represent.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Storing1981"

\end_inset

 Again, the issue was contact.
 Supporting direct service delivery (a role that is critical not only to
 public finance, but also democracy) requires a vehicle by which said activities
 can propagate.
 That is, the resources to deliver these services must be reliably generated
 from a viable and stable revenue source.

 It is this variety that provides a vehicle for demand articulation within
 the public sphere.
 Insofar as taxpayers are free to choose among a set of taxation-expenditure
 bundles, the system intrinsically seeks to minimize the deadweight loss
 associated with coerced conformity.
 Tiebout sorting requires some unrealistic assumptions in perfect information
 and costless mobility, but there does appear to be empirical support for
 the occurrence of sorting.

While this does look promising, Ross and Yinger note that homogeneity as

 results are also consistent with the consensus bidding framework.

An extensive review of the sorting literature is beyond the scope of this

Having established the operational handles of an abstract local tax, the
 choice of specific taxes should strive to capture the ideal elements of
 a local tax: immobility, adequacy/buoyancy, stabilty/predictability, fairness,
 administrative ease, non-exportality, and visibility (i.e.
 transparency).
 For the most part, these characteristics are goals for any tax at any level.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that these are theoretical objectives for tax design, identified for
 the purpose of maintaining a tight coupling between revenue generation
 and expenditure allocation.
 Such a coupling seeks to create a tight response for taxpayers, so that
 they may link the costs they feel from taxes with the benefits of service
 delivery in a manner that minimizes noise from other factors.
 The stronger this linkage, the greater the capacity for taxpayers to equalize
 costs and benefits at the margin.
 In practice, however, political expediency has an outsized role in the
 selection of available revenue handles, and can distort the role of other
 characteristics.
 For example, from a political perspective, exportability becomes an asset
 for those promoting a given tax.

\end_inset

 (and subsequently supported by Bird, Gramlich, and others), the idea of
 open and closed jurisdictions plays a prominent role.
 Closed jurisdictions are characterized by sufficiently high exit costs
 as to discourage departure from the jurisdiction over a wide range of tax
 prices.
 While the national government may feature this property, local governments
 do not.
 Local governments must contend with open borders, also known as low costs
 of exit.
 It is for this reason that a graduated income tax with comparable progressivity
 to the national model does not exist at the subnational level.
 Local officials are worried that taxpayers may simply choose to reside
 somewhere else.
 In this light, the fixed nature of real property makes it an attractive
 base upon which to levy a local tax.

The classical approach to the theory of Public Finance - with its neglect

The property tax as an object of study is an immense topic worthy of the

 Insofar as they reduce property tax revenue by construction, the impact
 of deviations from the property base carry clear first order effects.
 The ultimate systemic impact on revenue performance and utilization is
 less than clear.
 It is not known, for example, whether or not these deviations make the
 property tax a more palatable revenue instrument for taxpayers.

 Tax receipts as a percentage of total current receipts has declined from

 Within tax receipts, the decline in proportion of property revenue is still

 Sales taxes (7% to 16%) and income taxes (1% to 4%) have filled the void.

 The interpretation is that there are few scenarios in which the local fiscal

 One example of such an opportunity would be the selection and implementation

 The largest circle, the
