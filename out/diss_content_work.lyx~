 Tax Limitations - Voting, Colorado Ballot #1, 1992

\begin_layout Standard
In 1992, by a vote of 812,308 to 700,906, Colorado voters chose to amend
 Section 20 of Article X of the Colorado State Constitution.
 The initiative is known as the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR), one of
 the most well-known tax and expenditure limitations (TELs) in the United
 States.

What is the Purpose of this Inquiry?
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:ResearchObjectives"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this study writ large is to explore the endogenous role of
 fiscal institutions in emergent fiscal outcomes.
 The class of institutions studied here, tax and expenditure limitations,
 act directly on fiscal outcomes by restricting the set of feasible choices
 for revenue generation and the allocation of public funds.
 These institutions, however, are generally enacted as a response to dissatisfac
tion with realized fiscal outcomes.
 It would be reasonable to push this point further: the magnitude of the
 restriction bears some relationship to extent of the dissatisfaction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such endogeneity is notoriously difficult to untangle, even when the scope
 of the phenomenon under study is restricted.
 In the case of tax and expenditure limitations, there are many moving parts.
 TELs typically have broad application, affecting jurisdictions with wide
 variation in socioeconomic circumstance and constituent preference.
 Each of these jurisdictions differs in its revenue portfolio, as well as
 the complexity and scope of its expenditure responsibilities.
 Furthermore, each of these subsystems is vulnerable to the whims of macro-level
 fluctuations in economic activity and legal structure.
 Analytic tractability requires a reduction in the data space, so that we
 may tie together a plausible model of the world.
 This reduction is necessary in any rigorous analysis, but endogeneity is
 not making the task any easier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason, we identify three broad objectives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Evaluate the impact of TELs on revenue yield and capacity;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Evaluate the extent to which TELs impact expenditure choices; and,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Explore whether or not TELs help to align voter preferences with fiscal
 outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is the Value Added?
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:ValueAdd"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This kind of analysis is not novel in a broad sense.
 As we will see, there exists a formidable literature on TELs.
 There are two major elements that differentiate this study from those that
 have preceded it.
 First, rather than focus on a single policy (e.g.
 TABOR), this analysis models the joint impact of overlapping policies.
 The most novel element of this approach is abstraction away from the explicit
 program elements.
 Previous studies have often modeled the existence of TELs with binary indicator
s, or built an index score based upon factors like method of passage (statutory
 vs.
 constitutional), ease of override, and the magnitude of the growth ceiling
 among other things.
 Unless we believe that the impacts of TELs are additive, binary approaches
 lack the informational resolution to model the joint impacts of overlapping
 policies.
 Index methods, on the other hand, have a commensurability problem.
 Just because one TEL has a statutory authorization and another has a constituti
onal authorization, is the former fundamentally less restrictive than the
 latter in all cases? Even if we roll all elements of the index into the
 equation, does an override procedure have universal impact irrespective
 of the joint distribution of remaining TEL components? Both the binary
 and index approaches also suffer from lack of variation in the impact across
 jurisdictions.
 The restrictiveness of TELs, as we will see, is quite dependent upon the
 circumstances of the constrained jurisdiction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For all of these reasons, this study attacks the issue from a different
 perspective.
 To operationalize these policies, 
\emph on
the focus is shifted from program design to program impact
\emph default
.
 Instead of asking how a TEL was passed, for example, we ask what is the
 feasible levy given the existence of the policy? This approach rests on
 a constraint function that carries arguments for revenue impact and jurisdictio
n-specific characteristics.
 In so doing, it avoids implicit assumptions about commensurability, facilitates
 modeling of joint impact for multiple policies, and provides continuous
 variation across jurisdictions.
 Ultimately, the aforementioned deficiencies are hard to overcome, and indeed,
 this study makes an imperfect attempt.
 We will still have to make some assumptions that are less than desirable.
 However, the philosophy followed here suggests that more is knowable about
 the impact of TELs on specific jurisdictions, and we should use that informatio
n to the extent possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second major innovation in the world TEL research is the explicit acknowledg
ement of spatial dependency.
 No jurisdiction operates in a vacuum.
 By virtue of the fact that this study evaluates the impact of state-enacted
 policies on local governments, the very design suggests that vertical relations
hips across governmental entities matter.
 Horizontal relationships are also important components of the system.
 As it turns out, externalities are real.
 The impact of one jurisdiction influences, and is influenced by, the actions
 of jurisdictions in the local neighborhood.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The local neighborhood represents jurisdictions that are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the jurisdiction in question.
 What it means to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 varies by analytic objective.
 For our purposes, we use local neighborhood to mean the jurisdictions that
 are spatially proximate.
 For a different purpose, one might alternatively define 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to be similarity in industrial base, or demographic composition, or some
 other variable set of interest.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In a manner quite similar to omission of temporal dependency, omitting
 spatial dependency can lead to false signals.
 Does a given jurisdiction respond to the TEL constraint as the spatially-static
 model suggests, or is the measured response a function of the actions of
 neighbors? The smaller the jurisdiction, the greater the influence of overlappi
ng populations, commercial activity, and shared resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether or not these innovations change the picture painted by previous
 literature, they seek to account for potentially confounding elements in
 the measurement space.
 In so doing, agreement would serve only to bolster the robustness of earlier
 findings.
 More importantly, however, these approaches (of which this study provides
 only a test drive) open the door for a wider scope of inquiry than was
 available with the binary and index approaches.
 In particular, the incorporation of jurisdictional variation in impact
 helps local policymakers to better understand policy implications for their
 own specific circumstance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is the Spatial Scope of Analysis?
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:SpatialScope"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The geographic scope of this study is the State of Colorado.
 It was chosen because it features what is widely regarded as one of the
 most restrictive TEL regimes in the United States.
 TABOR, specifically, is often mentioned in the same breath as California's
 Proposition 13 and Massachusetts' Proposition 2
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$
\backslash
frac{1}{2}$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 when describing what a restrictive regime looks like.
 That being said, TABOR is just one piece of the puzzle.
 The TEL landscape also includes the Gallagher Amendment (GA) and the Statewide
 Limitation on Property Tax Revenue (SLPTR), two additional restrictions
 that act upon local governments.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Colorado features additional restrictions like Amendment 23 and policies
 acting on the state level.
 This analysis, thus, represents only a partial representation of the entire
 landscape.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 All three of these policies have significant implications for the property
 tax, which is the dominant element of own-source revenue for local governments
 in the state.
 As a consequence of this intersection, the impact on property tax revenue
 is the dominant focus for operationalizing the impact of these policies.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
So enters an implicit assumption that is less than ideal.
 TABOR actually has broader revenue scope than SLPTR and GA, but the constructio
n of the composite constraint used in the empirical modeling requires a
 common object upon which the policies can act.
 The property tax serves that role, and therefore acts as a proxy in the
 TABOR case for the dynamics associated with the broader revenue portfolio.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Counties serve as the unit of analysis for a number of reasons.
 First, general purpose jurisdictions are convenient insofar as they feature
 greater variety in service responsibilities.
 To understand the impact of TELs on expenditure behavior (the second research
 objective), this variation will prove useful because it facilitates identificat
ion of differential impacts from TELs.
 Suppose an extreme case in which we have classified expenditure behavior
 into only high and low expenditure categories.
 We may be able to extract a good sense of the likelihood of a TEL pushing
 a jurisdiction into one category or the other, but determining the precise
 magnitude of the shift is less straightforward.
 Increasing the number of categories or switching to interval expenditure
 data
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Switching from categorical to interval data is effectively equivalent to
 increasing the number of categories,

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 helps us answer that question.
 Splitting the expenditure into more functions refines our understanding
 even better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, counties are favored over municipalities for reasons of spatial
 parsimony.
 There are 62 counties in Colorado, and two consolidated city-county governments
 (Denver and Broomfield).
 For the purposes of this study, Denver and Broomfield are also treated
 as counties.
 This choice reflects the fact that Denver and Broomfield
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Broomfield County was created
 from parts of Adams, Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld counties effective November
 15, 2001.
 Estimates from BEA for Broomfield began in 2002.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 do not overlap, nor are they overlapped by, the conventional counties in
 the state.
 Moreover, this collection of 64 jurisdictions represents a spatially-exhaustive
 set of jurisdictional units.
 Municipalities do not feature these properties, nor do they consistently
 nest within counties.
 Thus, the use of municipalities would complicate the analysis substantially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third reason, and perhaps the most important, relates to the allocation
 of levy responsibility for the property tax.
 As we will see, property taxes are the dominant form of own-source revenue.
 Counties generally collect a greater share of property taxes relative to
 the other major general purpose jurisdictional form: municipalities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, counties are also analytically convenient from a data availability
 standpoint.
 Data is collected extensively at the county-level by both state and federal
 statistical authorities.
 At the state level, the information used in this study is collected by
 the Colorado State Division of Local Affairs.
 They provide excellent, standardized fiscal information and limited demographic
 information over the study window.
 The federal sources (predominately the US Census Bureau) do not feature
 the same reporting frequency in some cases, but the set of socioeconomic
 variables is much greater than that which is collected by the state.

\begin_layout Standard
This study examines the fiscal response of counties to TELs over the 1993-2009
 time period.
 The start date reflects the first year in which all three TELs of interest
 (TABOR, GA, and SLPTR) acted upon the counties in Colorado.
 The end date, by contrast, reflects a less conceptually relevant rationale.
 At the start of the this inquiry, the latest available data in the Colorado
 County and Municipal Financial Compendium was for 2009.

A Word on TELs as an Instrument of Democracy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will become apparent in what follows that TELs are much like sledgehammers.
 If binding, they can have large effects on the fiscal behavior of affected
 jurisdictions, producing foundational shifts in the trajectories of revenues
 and expenditures.
 Precision, however, is not the a major strength of the approach.
 They can just as easily create structural imbalances as combat waste, fraud
 and abuse perpetuated by local officials.
 And yet, by all accounts, they are quite popular.
 The student of fiscal affairs must consider why this is the case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Canonical public finance is taught from a perspective of the state as an
 exogenous actor.
 The unfettered market, while a remarkably useful mechanism, is characterized
 by certain problematic defects that limit its ability to produce desirable
 outcomes.
 Public policy is typically proposed 
\emph on
to counteract these market failures.

 The very idea that such a thing is possible requires a belief in our ability
 to objectively observe and diagnose a problem, and redirect activity.
 It requires a belief in the ability of the state to act on the economy
 from the outside.
 The orthodox question is

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Their viewpoint could still be framed in a public versus private context.
 In reality, this is a gross oversimplification.
 It is convenient to frame the tradeoffs between private and public action
 as two forces acting against each other, but Buchanan did in fact view
 the state as solely a collection of rules and institutions, as is made
 clear in the appendix of 2004 reprinting of the book by Liberty Fund, Inc.
 This conception was critical to his distinction between positive and normative
 theories of politics.
 
\end_layout

A positive science of politics should analyze the operation of an existing,
 or a postulated, set of rules for collective decision-making quite independent
 of the efficacy of this set in furthering or in promoting certain 'social
 goals'.
 A normative theory of politics should, by contrast, array the alternative
 sets of rules in accordance with their predicted efficiency in producing
 certain ends or goals which should be, if possible, made quite explicit.

The orthodox approach does not, however, lend itself well to a comparative

The analysis in this study is generally built on the orthodox view, but
 we should at least momentarily consider a reframing of public action that
 may make the proliferation of TELs somewhat easier to understand.
 Richard Wagner suggests that perhaps it is inappropriate to think of the
 market and state as actors.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Neither construct actually does anything at all.
 Rather, they are regulatory constructs the govern the allowable actions

 To borrow his terminology, they are not actors, but fora.

The ability to separate these groups is a function of the governance structure
 that prevails in a society at a given time.
 Monarchy serves as the primary example of a governance structure that allows
 for separability.
 Indeed, Wagner suggests that our monarchal roots are the cause for the
 orthodox view.
 In a democratic society, however, separability does not hold.
 The same people operate in both the state and market fora.
 The only distinction is that each forum has its own set of operational
 rules that differentiate how each facilitates the extraction and processing
 of resources into services for the public.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Viewed from this angle, the task of the state does not exist.
 The task of the public is to design state rules that better align services
 rendered with its preferences, from within the existing, yet mutable, set
 of rules

\emph default
Institutional rules are complex and, importantly, are not conducive to smooth
 adjustment as a function of societal welfare.
 That is, there is no straightforward way to change the rules in a way that
 maps exactly to the optimal welfare value for a collection of people.
 If a jurisdiction increases taxes on cigarettes, the measurement of the
 welfare impact must take into account consumers, producers, and all of
 the participants auxiliary activity related to the production and consumption
 of cigarettes.
 This view is complicated by knock on effects, as well as the existence
 and regulation of many other products and services.
 Furthermore, it turns out that welfare is difficult to measure to begin
 with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choice of rules must also contend with the issue of degradation.
 For its noble beginnings and the important benefits still conferred today,
 the American version of democracy is not without its challenges.
 To choose only one aspect, equal representation is more easily idealized
 than realized.
 In the modern political age, it has become clear that even the definition
 of equal representation is fairly unclear.
 At the base, we can all agree on a single vote for each voter.
 The ability, however, to influence the agenda confers great benefits on
 those who execute the task successfully.
 Attempts to limit that power, however, are hamstrung by the need to apply
 rules in a general way.
 Designing rules that do not also abridge basic rights is a significant
 challenge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this context, ballot initiatives like those that produce tax and expenditure
 limitations, blunt as though they may be, emerge as a method of circumventing
 the agenda setting power of established interest groups that have refined
 their ability to influence the policymaking process.
 They are seen as enhancing the role of the public in a democratic mechanism
 that must deal with some thorny issues.
 To be sure, interest groups have strong influence in promoting the passage
 or failure of these initiatives.
 From the perspective of the voter, however, the at least apparent civic
 return may outweigh any lack of precision associated with the instruments.
 Furthermore, and this is important, even if the mix of outcomes is not
 quite right, the central tendency may be more in line with the voter's
 preference than the outcomes generated by conventional means.
 Whether or not all of the variables are appropriately weighed in decisions
 about these tradeoffs is an empirical question.

In his treatise, 
\emph on
The Theory of Public Finaince 
\emph default
(
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Musgrave59"

\end_inset

), Professor Musgrave constructed a framework for conceptualizing public
 finance in a federal system that has proven robust to a remarkably varied
 set of research inquiries.
 This framework once again proves useful in explaining the significance
 of subnational finance in the US.
 Musgrave's approach defines three primary tasks for the public sector in
 an economy, and allocates those functions to the appropriate level of governmen
t.
 For the purposes of this analysis, the front end of the framework (function
 definition) proves directly applicable while some modification of the back
 end (allocation of functions) may be needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Musgrave, there are three primary roles for the public sector:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Direct service delivery (i.e.
 allocation);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Redistribution of resources; and,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Macroeconomic stabilization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first (allocation) is the direct product of government operation, the
 most direct link to taxes paid.
 The second (redistribution) seeks to adjust resource allocations to accord
 with societal preferences for distributional equity.
 An additional motivation for this function can be the mitigation of damages

 Mobility is not required for the latter to have an effect.

For a public good - the consumption of which defined over geographical subsets

 of the good are the same for the central or for the respective local government

 governments to provide Pareto-efficient levels of output for their respective
 jurisdictions than for the central government to provide any specified

 transparency).
 For the most part, these characteristics are goals for any tax at any level.
\begin_inset Foot

Note that these are theoretical objectives for tax design, identified for
 the purpose of maintaining a tight coupling between revenue generation
 and expenditure allocation.
 Such a coupling seeks to create a tight response for taxpayers, so that
 they may link the costs they feel from taxes with the benefits of service
 delivery in a manner that minimizes noise from other factors.
 The stronger this linkage, the greater the capacity for taxpayers to equalize
 costs and benefits at the margin.
 In practice, however, political expediency has an outsized role in the
 selection of available revenue handles, and can distort the role of other
 characteristics.
 For example, from a political perspective, exportability becomes an asset
 for those promoting a given tax.

 (and subsequently supported by Bird, Gramlich, and others), the idea of
 open and closed jurisdictions plays a prominent role.
 Closed jurisdictions are characterized by sufficiently high exit costs
 as to discourage departure from the jurisdiction over a wide range of tax
 prices.
 While the national government may feature this property, local governments
 do not.
 Local governments must contend with open borders, also known as low costs
 of exit.
 It is for this reason that a graduated income tax with comparable progressivity
 to the national model does not exist at the subnational level.
 Local officials are worried that taxpayers may simply choose to reside
 somewhere else.
 In this light, the fixed nature of real property makes it an attractive
 base upon which to levy a local tax.

 The interpretation is that there are few scenarios in which the local fiscal

 One example of such an opportunity would be the selection and implementation
 of the accounting system used to track receipts collected by the jurisdiction's

 With each successively larger circle, the subset of variables controlled

 Indirect impacts are driven by increased expenditure risk for governments

 As mentioned previously, one of the most critical aspects of a local revenue

 The immobility of the property tax base, for instance, derives much of
 its value from the decision of economic actors to site themselves within
 the jurisdiction in question.
 To the extent that economic coordination requires spatially proximate associati

 leverage this siting choice.
 Even if the country as a whole experienced no net loss in population, those
 local jurisdictions with comparatively high revenue requirements stand
 to lose a great deal.
 Beyond that, siting within the US in general is not quite as necessary

 This issue is particularly acute at the local level since the available

 Obviously the capacity for anyone to anticipate a specific occurrence of

For the local fiscal manager, the assault on revenues during a recession
 comes from multiple fronts.
 The first, and most direct, impact comes from the reduced tax collections
 stemming from a reduction in economic activity.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Economic activity, as used here, captures both the value generated from
 transactional interactions among economic actors and the change in capital
 value associated with said transactions.
 For example, many buyers and sellers in a local real estate market generate
 value with marginal returns to each transaction on average.
 Such a market is also likely to see increases in the value of the housing
 stock as a whole.
 Both are functions of underlying demand, which would be depressed in a
 recession.

 The downside of thei development is a strong dependency by local governments
 on transfers from both state and national coffers.
 When the economy enters a recession, while the impacts on own source revenue
 may differ as a function of revenue base disparities, a certain amount

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Lack of Uniformity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tax is not actually an ad valorem tax in the sense that it is not levied
 on a fixed percentage of property value.
 Instead, the assessment ratio and/or tax rate are calculated in a way that
 takes the taxing jurisdiction's desired total levy as a primary argument.
 This construct creates the capacity for significant variation in burdens
 across jurisdictions, due to the variations in fiscal requirements.
 The result is horizontal inequity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Lack of Universality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite numerous historical attempts to create a general purpose tax (which
 Seligman discusses in some detail), the practical problem of capturing
 personal property in a way that is commensurate with levies on real property
 creates disparities in burden that are driven by occupational genre rather
 than ability to pay or benefits received.
 These practical problems are a function of both political manipulation
 and the difficulty in getting a handle on intangible/administratively inconveni
ent personal property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Incentive for Dishonesty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When entire classes of property are exempt from taxation, Seligman correctly
 argues that avoidance incentives are high.
 The rational taxpayer will shift assets to protected classes whenever possible.
 In many cases, such practices have exerted pressure on, or entirely breached,
 the boundary between avoidance and evasion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Regressivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seligman's context for this complaint involved his observance of the transition
 away from the agrarian social context that characterized the early period
 in US history.
 In particular, famers were disadvantaged in the practical taxation of property
 because their assets were quite intangible and visible.
 In contrast, holdings derived from trade often enjoyed tax exempted status,
 either de facto or de jure, as a consequence of their intractability as
 administratively feasible tax handles.
 Since trading wealth often exceeded that which was derived from agriculture,
 this feature was a regressive one.
 This framework holds today in the sense that personal property can drive
 a tremendous wedge in aggregate asset holdings across homeowners.
 To the extent that personal property is taxes inconsistently at best, Seligman'
s concerns are still valid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Double Taxation

\begin_layout Standard
Property is taxed in practice based upon the value of the asset, 
\emph on
not the value of the property owned by the taxpayer.

\emph default
 Insofar as the development of modern finance techniques has bifurcated
 equity stakes in a given piece of property, the individual that physically
 holds the asset is being taxed on his/her property

 the liquidity for the taxpayer to buy the asset.

 This was perhaps Seligman's most significant condemnation because it identified
 a structural phenomenon with the potential to divorce the basis of taxation

Thus, while we can advance the economic critique of reform movements and

political economy approach to fiscal federalism.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 It differs from the fiscal federalism approach that Oates advanced in 1972,
 largely due to differing evaluations of two key assumptions.
 First, traditional fiscal federalism assumes that officials seek to maximize
 the welfare of the jurisdiction they serve.
 This pursuit leads naturally to strong welfare gains as a consequence of
 local variation, leading to tax-expenditure bundles that can be better
 tailored to local conditions.
 The political economy approach makes no such assumption, leaving room for
 political calculation that may be out of phase with actual maximization
 of constituent welfare.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Perrson_Tabellini2000,Besley_Case1995"

\end_inset

 Second, the political economy literature does not assume, as traditional
 fiscal federalism does, that central provision implies uniform public output.
 Variations in output can and do arise from the legislative process and
 the insertion of non-neutralities.
 These non-neutralities typically arise as a consequence of the variety
 of political power endowments and cultivation efforts across local jurisdiction
s.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 I would extend this further to remark that, in the context of varying local
 conditions, the effect of non-neutralities is far from clear cut.
 Moreover, variance in local implementation carries its own additional source
 of variance in public outputs.

This view of political economy of public finaince is salient in the current

 Although the institutional reforms have limited the efficacy of the property

 If these reforms prolong the use of the property tax, then a tool of fiscal

 Indeed, the third empirical section in this study scratches the surface
 on the idea of fiscal institutions as an instrument of democracy.
 This is not to imply that the operational impacts of the day are to be

One of the challenges in researching relief mechanisms is the establishment

 The variety in implementation that occurs for these relief mechanisms creates
 an environment in which considerable grey areas arise in classification.
 Bowman notes that these arise because all property tax relief measures
 necessarily act on one of three things: the tax base, the tax rate, or
 the income of the taxpayer.

 For this reason, this section will use Bowman's definition of circuit breakers.
 The key criterion for qualification as a circuit breaker is

 On the one hand, circuit breakers can increase the propensity of the constituen

 To the extent that a voter already owes the maximum allowable percentage
 of their property value, votes for increased property taxes carry no additional
 cost.
 On the other hand, circuit breakers directly decrease the property tax
 base, thereby potentially increasing liabilities for everyone else.
 Consequently, this instrument does particularly well to stoke tensions
 in the politicial space (voters abover the threshold versus voters below
 the threshold) that serve as an instrinsic characteristic of public finance.

Homestead Exemptions

The homestead exemption was a product of the housing issues experienced
 during the Great Depression.
 At the time, the incomes of taxpayers were plummeting, creating untenable

 The response to this issue in 14 states was an exemption on a predefined
 portion of property value.
 (Walker(1964) via

 The proliferation of the instrument slowed as macroeconomic conditions

 Unlike circuit breakers, homestead exemptions were poorly targeted and
 conferred arguably undue relief on relatively affluent individuals.

\begin_layout Standard
Homestead exemptions generally apply to owner-occupied housing.
 The vehicle for relief is a fixed portion of the property value.
 This portion can either be measured in a static dollar amount, or it can
 be structured as a percentage of home value.
 The choice among these two definitions carries significant implications
 for vertical equity.
 The former is more progressive because it does not permit an increase in
 the size of the benefit as a function of increasing home values (which
 are typically associated with higher incomes).

In those states with a legal classification system, business property is

 property.
 Within the business class, utility property is usually assesses or taxed
 higher than other business property.
 Clearly this reflects the reality of electoral and legislative politics.
 Every home and every farm is represented by one or more voters.
 Utility companies are far less represented in the electorate.

 In particular, they are designed to assist seniors that may have benefited

Admittedly, Proposition 13 was a particularly aggressive limitation effort.
 It does serve, however, to demonstrate the types of impacts that can occur
 with these reforms.
 Such effects do not occur everywhere, particularly when reforms are not
 of the binding variety defined by Mullins and Joyce.
 Binding limitations provide no workaround to achieve the same revenue targets.
 A two-part composite reform created this environment in California.
 Passed on June 2, 1978, Proposition 13 limited assessment increases to
 2% annually and mandated a rate ceiling of 1%.
 Rather than address the revenue yield directly, voters chose to limit the
 base and rate inputs.
 Furthermore, assessed values reverted back to 1976 levels.
 Couple this reduction in the base with the practice of acquisition value
 assessement, in which real estate values only reflect the market value
 at the time of sale, and one gets a potent mix for revenue reduction.

Which Revenue Sources are Employed?

From a revenue perspective, in real terms, Colorado has experienced consistent
 growth over the 1975-2009 time period.
 Overall, county revenue increased by 72% over the period on average (from
 $1,013 to $1,741).
 These measures of central tendency, however, mask considerable variation
 in the individual trajectories of specific counties.
 The average range of per capita revenue was $3,772 over the same period.
 Note also that the median revenue per capita increase (63%) did not significant
ly lag the mean increase, suggesting a relatively stable distribution of
 county revenue across time.

Somewhat surprisingly, the growth in tax receipts (+187%) over the period
 outpaced growth in intergovernmental transfers (+42%).
 As Mullins and Joyce have noted, there has been a general increase in local
 dependency on higher level transfers in addition to dependency on fees
 and charges associated with the imposition of strong TELs.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Joyce_Mullins1991"

\end_inset

 In fairness, however, the target of these TELs is usually the property
 tax.
 While the property tax has grown in terms of receipts (+168%), it has fallen
 as a percentage of total tax revenue (-6.5%).
 Moreover, the growth in sales revenue as a percentage of all tax revenues
 has increased dramatically (+30%).
 It has also stood out as the fastest growing revenue source (+273%).
 Although it remains a small portion of the overall portfolio, license revenu
 grew faster than all other sources (+489%), followed by revenue from charges
 (+406%).
 This growth is consistent with the expected impacts of TEL policies.

While debt service has been the fastest growing liability for counties in
 Colorado (+633%), it still remains a small portion of the overall budget
 (4.7% in 2009).
 The dominant liability resides with operating expenditures.
 Given the preponderence of direct spending activity at the local level,
 this is unsurprising.
 Operating expenditures increased 116% over the period, but fell as a percentage
 of total expenditures (79% to 76%).
 Within operating expenditures, the fastest growing line item was judicial
 expenditure (+263%), although it constituted only 3.6% of operating expenditures
 in 2009.
 The real story is in public safety, which grew 231% over the period.
 This spending increased its compositional importance notably, growing from
 19% to 29% of operating expenditures and 15% to 22% of total expenditures.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
1988: The SLPTR was decreased to 5.5%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
1991: The statutory state-level General Fund appropriation limit (a.k.a the
 Arveshoug-Bird Limit or ABL) caps growth at the lesser of either 5% of
 growth in statewide income, or 6% growth over the previous year's appropriation
 level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While multiple limits act at the state level, our focus for this analysis
 is local revenue behavior.
 In particular, we are concerned with the property tax, which has stood
 out over time as the most important revenue source for local governments.
 For this reason, we will further unpack the three most significant reforms
 in this areas a bit further: TABOR, SLPTR, and GA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Taxpayer's Bill of Rights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TABOR is, in and of itself, a composite measure that acts on individual
 tax districts.
 Tax districts in this case represent local jurisdictions that raise revenue,
 such as general purposes municipalities, counties, and school districts.
 It features three major elements that work in concert to limit revenue
 growth: voter approaval for tax increases, a limitation on the growth in
 revenue, and protection of the existing limits.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the purposes of TABOR, a tax increase is defined as any one of the following
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
New tax instrument;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tax rate increase;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Local mill levy increase;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Property assessment valuation ratio increase;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Extension of an expiring tax; or,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Any tax policy resulting in a net tax revenue gain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If any of the above are proposed, they must be validated by explicit voter
 approval in the jurisdiction in question.
 On the other side, no voter approval is required for a tax decrease.
 Note, however, that such a decrease resets the baseline to a new, lower
 level.
 This is one manifestation of the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ratchet effect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which will be explored further below.
 TABOR also explicitly prohibits some types of new taxes.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Prohibited taxes include new or increased real estate transfers, local income
 taxes, state property taxes, and surcharges on state income taxes.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The limit on annual revenue growth for a tax district is set by formula,
 which generally accounts for increases in inflation
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Consumer Price Index serves as the inflation measure.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and some measure of growth.
 At the state level, revenue growth is limited to CPI plus population growth.
 For local general purpose districts, growth is limited to CPI plus growth
 in the volume of jurisdictional housing stock.
 School districts, by contrast, are bound by CPI growth plus growth in school
 enrollment.
 Any surplus revenue must be returned to taxpayers as credits or refunds.
 Note that at the state level, the revenue subject to TABOR (a.k.a.
 the TABOR base) constituted only 58.5% of the entire budget in the FY02-03
 fiscal cycle.
 The two largest sources were the individual income, sales, and use taxes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TABOR also raised the bar for efforts to modify existing limitations.
 Prior to its passage, ABL could have been weakened by a simple majority
 vote in the General Assembly.
 TABOR requires explicit voter approval for changes to ABL or any other
 limitations.
 This element of the reform is viewed by Colorado legislative analysts as
 being incorporated with ABL specifically in mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps the most restrictive feature of TABOR is the implicit 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ratchet effect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If, in a given year, revenue fails to exhaust the allowable increase, the
 new baseline is set at a lower level.
 For example, if in year zero a jurisdiction received $100 million in revenue,
 and the CPI plus the growth factor totaled 6% in the allowable increase,
 the TABOR limit is $106 million in year one.
 Similar inflation and growth activity in the following year would allow
 for approximately $112.4 million in year two.
 If, perhaps for economic reasons, only $105 million is actually collected
 in year one, the maximum allowable revenue in year two would be $111.3 million.
 Thus, failing to hit the limit in a given year has a dynamic effect, forever
 lowering the baseline growth trajectory of revenue.
 This becomes problematic when expenditures are out of phase with revenues.

DeBrucing
\end_layout

One characteristic of TABOR that appears to be a confounding element initially
 is the capacity of local jurisdictions to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

deBruce
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 DeBrucing is the process by which a local government can vote on whether
 or not its tax base should be subject to the constraints of TABOR.
 One may consider this override capacity to be a robust safety valve, sufficient
 to invalidate any claims of undue restriction imposed by reform.
 If a jurisdiction can actually vote to exempt itself from reform, how can
 it impact fiscal choices? The analysis that follows will reveal that there
 is indeed a very real impact from this reform that results in observable
 impacts on the revenue and expenditure behavior of affected jurisdictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ultimately, despite initially appearing to be an analytic liability, the
 existence of deBrucing emerges as an opportunity for greater estimating
 precision.
 In particular, the practice provides an important source of horizontal
 variation, allowing us to more cleanly separate macroeconomic conditions
 from the policy structure.
 The nature of this separation will be considered in further detail in Subsectio

Statewide Limitation of Property Tax Revenue

As mentioned above, the SLPTR is among the oldest limitations in Colorado.
 It was originally enacted in 1913, but its most recent level (5.5%) is a
 vestige of its last modification in 1988.
 The structure of the limit, a constant ceiling, is quite straightforward.
 For our purposes, the interest is in how this limit interacts with TABOR.
 To the extent that the TABOR limit may be above or below 5.5% in any given
 year for a given county, we must account for variation in which limit binds
 over time.

Gallagher Amendment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In response to a dramatic increase in residential property values and the
 lack of uniformity in assessment practices that characterized the 1970s,

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The State Board of Equalization, tasked with evaluating property tax valuation
 schemes; and,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Gallagher Amendment (GA).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the residential assessment rate reduction, GA provided a
 dynamic relief mechanism for residential property taxpayers.
 GA automatically adjusts the residential assessment rate each year to hold
 the residential share of total assessed value constant.
 That is, even when residential assessment growth outpaces nonresidential
 assessment growth, the proportion of the property tax paid by residential
 taxpayers will not increase as a result.
 That being said, modification is allowed in the event of new construction.
 In other words, 
\emph on
the residential share of property taxes in Colorado cannot increase as a
 consequence of an increase in tax unit value, but it can increase when
 the number of tax units increases.

\emph default
 Modification of the rate for new construction has been limited in practice.
 The residential share of assessment value was approximately 45% when GA
 was implemented in 1982.
 As of 2003, the rate had only increased to 47%.

\begin_layout Standard
The residential assessment rate imposed via GA is calculated based upon
 the aggregate assessed values in the state.
 Thus, the rates are calculated in a manner which masks substantial variation
 in growth profiles and the mix of properties in individual counties.
 Indeed, we will leverage this variation in modeling the impact of reform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also important to note that TABOR has has an impact on how GA works
 in practice.
 Prior to TABOR's passage, if non-residential property increased in value
 at a rate greater than residential property, residential assessment rates
 could be adjusted upward automatically to maintain the statewide ratio
 of residential to non-residential assessment.
 After TABOR, assessment increases were counted as tax increases, and thus
 required explicit voter approval.
 In this way, TABOR not only introduces TABOR-specific asymmetric pressure
 (it is easier to lower than raise taxes), but it also produces asymmetric
 interaction effects with other policies.

\end_inset

Cross-state studies have all but neglected an assessment of the effects
 of tax and expenditure limitations on the fiscal structure within the local
 public sector.
 Even within the ranks of the individual state studies, there has been limited
 attention to these types of effects.
 While results point to the use of alternative revenue sources and intergovernme
ntal transfers, effects on the actual composition and response of the local
 public sector are largely absent.
 Have tax and expenditure limitations changed the face of the local public
 sector and its interaction with local populations? Has it done so uniformly?
 And what are the implications of any of these structural changes for local
 governance? [...] The outcome with regard to local discretion may be one of
 asymmetric truncation of the ability to exercise local choice, such that
 the variation in service availability across jurisdictions increases.
 While this increased variation may superficially appear as Tiebout inspired,
 it will be driven not by responsiveness to local desires, but by a reinforcemen
t of differential abilities to respond.

The author would be hard pressed to state the implications of the change
 in focus any better.
 In effect, incorporation of local characteristics changes the types of
 questions that one seeks to answer.
 Instead trying to extrapolate from average effects, conditional analysis

 understand how tax and expenditure limitations affect their own jurisdiction,
 and the implications for how they serve their constituents.

 decade since Mullins' piece that sought to evaluate differential impacts
 based upon local conditions.
 Subsequent research that has cited the article generally extracts the associati
on between TELs and both the general propensity to shift revenue sources
 outside of the jurisdiction and a difficult environment for the collection
 of fiscal resources.
 One Colorado focused study explored the deleterious effects of recessions
 for jurisdictions affected by TABOR (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/
10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00752.x/), while another surprisingly found that being
 unable to override TABOR was not associated with increases in special districts
 (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2257.2012.00586.x/abstract).
 In neither case was county-specific socioeconomic context treated as a
 primary driver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author posits that this lack of work is driven in large part by the
 limitations of the methods used to measure the impact of TELs.
 Though we have learned a great deal from the approach, measurement has
 largely been conducted within the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

existence paradigm
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 That is, TEL effect is generally represented as a binary indicator or some
 close derivative.
 Even Mullins (2004), path breaking though it may be, employs a refinement
 of this technique.

This work measures TEL effect as a discrete variable which, at different
 points in the analysis, reflects simple existence, the extent of the TEL's
 binding nature, and/or the scope of the TEL's application.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 One limitation of this approach is the inability to model certain kinds
 of interactions between overlapping TELs.
 This is particularly relevant, as we will see, in the context of TABOR
 and SLPTR.
 Another limitation is the inability to differentiate the cumulative effect
 of a TEL regime across counties.
 In other words, there is little reason to believe that, given differing
 socioeconomic dynamics, five years under a TEL regime for county A will
 have the same implications as five years under a TEL regime for county
 B.
 Both limitations constrain the direct applicability of findings for local
 fiscal managers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution proposed here is abstraction away from the specific elements
 of the TELs in Colorado (COTELs) as the basis for operationalization.
 Rather, this study captures COTEL design indirectly, by evaluating the
 implications of COTELs for local revenue yield.
 By shifting the focus, we can overcome the aforementioned limitations.
 In effect, we want to capture some measure of COTEL intensity, that captures
 three primary characteristics of a given county at time

The indicator used in a previous version of the analysis in the first empirical
 section was simply an ordinal score that captured information on the first
 two characteristics.
 Effectively, the score added a point for each additional constraint.
 For example, all counties in 1987 would have a score of two given the general
 application of SLPTR and GA.
 The scores were subsequently modified by deBrucing, which occurred to some
 degree in 47 of 64 counties over the 1993-2009 time period.
 If only one of the policies was exempted, only one point would be removed.
 In effect, it was a cumulative indicator function.
 The reason it has value now is because it provided a clear view of the
 variety of policy application across counties (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

While this score was a useful starting point, the subsequent measure incorporate
s the county-specific dynamics captured in the third desired characteristic:
 the likelihood of a binding constraint.
 The new score was constructed based upon comparing the property tax base
 growth to the limit imposed by the conjunction of SLPTR and TABOR limits
 when both apply in a given year.
 If only one or the other applies (due to deBrucing) in a given county-year,
 then the limit is just that which is imposed by the policy in effect.
 The construction of a composite limitation variable is useful because 
\emph on
only one of the limits can be binding in any given county-year.

If the difference between the TABOR constraint and the SLPTR constraint
 is negative (TABOR less SLPTR), it indicates that TABOR was the dominant
 in a given county-year.
 Visualizing the distribution of this difference across counties and years
 reveals non-trivial variation in which policy was the effective constraint
 (Figure ).
 This is the kind of interaction, referenced earlier, that does not lend
 itself to easy capture by the existence paradigm of representing TELs.
 The TABOR/SLPTR constraint has been calculated as the minimum between the
 two for each county-year.

 increased revenue, the growth in the value of the base should be compared

 is of particular interest, the hypothesis here being that it captures a
 growing disparity between the economic activity that occurs in a given
 county and the governmental capacity to facilitate and/or regulate said
 activity.
 For example, one would expect it to be more costly to govern a county of
 50,000 people relative to a county of 1,000 people.
 There are simply more interactions, both social and economic, to mediate.
 The need for infrastructure grows, as does the need to finance a larger
 educational demand.
 These constraints, then, act as an instrument to decouple the trajectories
 of revenue potential and expenditure need.
 The author expects this to be a dynamic effect.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Gallagher Ratio
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the actions imposed by TABOR and SLPTR were conceptually similar,
 they lent themselves to integration.
 GA, by constrast, was modeled separately as simply the ratio between the
 residential and non-residential tax bases within a county.
 The idea here was to capture the impact of disparities between county ratios
 and the statewide ratio used to calculate allowable assessment rates.
 If a given county has a higher proportion of residential assessment value
 in its base, we would expect it to have a more difficult time raising revenue,
 since the residential assessment rates are held down to keep them consistent
 across the state.
 Conversely, higher proportions of non-residential assessment value serve
 to subsidize residential taxpayers in a given county, since only so much
 yield is required and their assessment ratios cannot be increased.
 The data required to construct this ratio come from the assessment information
 discussed in Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:TABOR-and-SLPTR-Measure"

\end_inset

.
 The distribution of this Gallagher Ratio can be seen in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Clearly the variation seen here suggests that county circumstances drive
 substantial variation in the impact of the Gallagher Amendment.

That a given data generating process may yield observations that are related
 to each other is not a new concept by any stretch of the imagination.
 So central has this concern been in the modern practice of statistical
 analysis, large swaths of theoretical development are devoted to methods
 of mitigating this confounding factor.
 The foundational model in econometrics - ordinary least squares - assumes
 it away with the assertion of independent observations for conceptual tractabil
ity.
 The analysis of real world data, however, often necessitates meeting this
 issue head on with a host of models designed to deal with this basic deviation
 from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

well behaved
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concern centers on the fact that, though approaches differ substantially,
 statistical estimation can generally be distilled down to a search for
 conditional expectation.
 The observed data have some observed central tendency, and each of the
 statistically significant variables that act on the system cause some sort
 of deviation from that central tendency.
 Measuring the deviation from that baseline expectation requires that the
 baseline be consistent throughout the observational space.
 If one desires to understand the relative heights of five people, he/she
 should either ensure they all stand on level ground, or capture five observatio
n-specific adjustments that yield the same effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important lesson that the field has learned is that variance in this
 baseline is not a deal breaker.
 If the relationship is systemic and estimable, the effect can be accommodated.
 The desire to understand when this stable reference can be relied upon
 is a strong argument for the establishment of stationarity.
 If we know that the relationship between observations follows a consistent
 joint distribution, or some reasonable facsimile, we can reliably estimate
 the impact of variables that impact the system.

\begin_layout Subsection

Autocorrelation and autoregression are sometimes differentiated in the literatur

 In many cases the former refers to serial correlation in the errors, while
 the latter refers to correlation in observations.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Tsay2005"

\end_inset

 We will use this distinction in this study, but in reality, scholars often
 use autocorrelation to describe correlation in both the errors and the
 observed values.
 Our definitional split will facilitate discussion of the implications of
 these two behaviors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the split we have defined, the two are not necessarily linked, insofar
 as an autoregressive process is only one potential cause of correlation
 in the error term.
 Other factors, like additional variables that have impacts lasting longer
 than one period, can also contribute to autocorrelation.
 This is a theoretically important distinction, insofar as unbiased estimates
 are still possible with uncorrelated observations, albeit inefficiently.
 In practice, however, they tend to occur jointly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

In fact, as Wold showed, when all the sample serial correlations of the
 [independent variables] are zero the estimates of variance given by the
 least squares method are strictly unbiased whether the errors are serially
 correlated or not.
 It seems to us doubtful, however, whether this result finds much application
 in practice.
 It will only rarely be the case that the independent variables are serially
 uncorrelated while the errors are serially correlated.

If we have a relationship in which the error term is autocorrelated, it
 has been shown by Aitken [...] that the method of least squares still yields
 the best linear unbiased estimates of the regression coefficients provided
 the lack of independence in the error series is taken into account.
 One method of overcoming this lack of independence is to make the error
 term random by transforming all the variables according to the autoregressive
 structure of the error term.

\begin_layout Description
Tapering captures the notion that services are generally delivered from
 a particular location.
 The farther one gets from this location, the smaller the benefit one may
 experience from a service emanating from said location.
 An easy example of this phenomenon is the provision of local fire fighting
 services.
 The farther one resides from the fire station, the longer it takes to consume
 the service in the event of a fire.
 This lag is likely to lead to larger amounts of damage if a fire is occurring.
 Thus, the expected benefit for residents who live

 from the station is lower than those that live 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 the station.
 This effect has implications for the definition of a pure public good.
 Tapering inhibits the ability to provide a service uniformly.
 Even if resources were such that all fire calls at any given time could
 be accommodated, a form of rivalry has creeped into the picture.
 Stochastic consumption of fire services is more heavily consumed as a function
 of spatial proximity.

 We must, however, acknowledge that resource disparities do exist and jurisdicti

 An optimal jurisdictional area would efficiently capture the tax-expenditure
 bundle preferred by the constituents, and the optimal size for a jurisdiction

The economic potential of any system is not only driven by the presence
 of natual and/or developed capital, but also the institutions that govern
 the exploitation of these valueable assets.
 In this sense, the term economic potential is misleadingly incomplete.
 The mechanism that drives resource allocation is a function of both the
 distribution of purely economic value and the feasible range of activities
 governed by political institutions.
 The goal of institutional design for economic growth, therefore, ought
 to be the facilitation of those activities that increase the marginal product
 of

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 efforts.
 If the objective is the maximization of economic growth, this broad goal
 is unlikely to draw many detractors.
 The devil, however, is in the details.
 The major challenge for any fiscal manager is operating under institutional
 constructs that reflect in one way or another the will of the constituents,
 while also achieving the expected fiscal outcomes.
 This task is challenging because these concepts are not separable.

Once the fiscal policy objectives or targets are decided upon government
 tries to implement them by using policy parameters, such as tax rates,
 subsidies, transfers, purchases and other types of government expenditures
 over which it has conrol.
 These parameters are known as instruments.
 Policy targets and instruments belong to the same economic system.
 The former are endogenous and the latter are pre-determined.
 The values policy targets take depend on the type of instruments employed,
 and the relation between them will be determined by the structure of the
 economy.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As used here, revenue yield signifies the actual, realized revenue collected
 by a given jurisdiction.
 Revenue capacity, by contrast, captures the economic potential of the tax
 base.
 We may think of this concept as the abstract revenue yield for a given
 county at some standard level of tax effort.
 If, for example, the property in county A is more expensive than the property
 in county B, county A can collect more revenue than county B with the same
 level of tax effort.
 In this example, county A has greater revenue capacity than county B.

For starters, from a Tiebout perspective, local revenue instruments are
 important because they act as prices for local constituents.
 They are the costs incurred by taxpayers in exchange for the consumption
 of local public services.
 Costs lead consumers to perform triage.
 Without costs, the strong monotonicity assumption is permitted run wild.
 In other words, constituents would seek to consume without limit.
 It is the provision of local revenue by taxpayers that reveals opportunity
 cost and forces them to reveal their preferences.
 In so doing, they provide the information required by local fiscal managers
 to make smart choices in service of satisfying voter preferences.

, local discretion over revenue sources is critical for local autonomy,
 an ideal that has been advocated on practical and theoretical grounds.
 Practical arguments extend back at least as far the debate over the crafting
 of the US Constitution.
 The so-called Anti-Federalists argued vociferously against the consolidation
 of power in central government.
 They believed that not only was this a sure path to a tyrannical regime,
 but also that it was remarkably unpractical to try and govern so vast and
 diverse a country from a single location.
 Representatives sent to higher levels of government could not possibly
 reflect the rich diversity of interests and needs that would inevitably
 fall within their purview.
 From a theoretical perspective, local autonomy facilitates the pursuit
 of the marginal equivalence of costs and benefits, an efficiency enhancing
 feature that naturally seeks welfare maximization for society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Detractors could feasibly argue that marginal equivalence is not actually
 possible because the costs of production are often uncoupled with the means
 of financing public goods.
 Furthermore, given disparities in resource endowments, there are limits
 to the volume and quality of services that can be provided for some local
 jurisdictions, no matter what their preferences are.
 For the sake of balance, we should also note that Federalists were greatly
 concerned by the potential for material harm to minority

 if local autonomy was too strong.
 Their bias towards central provision was cultivated in part because they
 believed the multitude of opinions expressed at higher levels of government

 resources.

What is the Expected Impact of TELs on Fiscal Convergence?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fiscal convergence in our context carries a spatial dimension.
 When one considers the siting choice of a taxpayer, theoretically, the
 entire set of local jurisdictions in the country is available to him or
 her.
 In reality, however, the costs associated with all of these choices is
 far from equal even when staying inside Colorado.
 Leaving aside cost of living for the purposes of our analysis, the costs
 of mobilization are non-trivial.
 It is much more costly for a resident of the northeastern County of Logan
 to move to the southwestern County of Montezuma, than it would be to move
 to the neighboring County of Morgan.
 Thus, convergence in fiscal outcomes does not have to be uniform across
 the entire state to have a significant impact.
 The activity that occurs in the local neighborhood, the collection of counties
 that are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the county of interest, is the driving factor.
 For this reason, we are concerned with the 
\emph on
clustering of fiscal behavior within the local neighborhood.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a theoretical standpoint, there are two main features of COTELs that
 would promote fiscal clustering among low-capacity jurisdictions in particular.
 First, COTELs impose asymmetric pressure on revenue yields over time.
 The rate of increase is limited by an explicit growth limit, but decreasing
 yields are not so constrained.
 Furthermore, once a drop in revenue has been experienced in one year, the
 baseline is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ratcheted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 down.
 The allowable revenue in the current year is measured against only the
 previous year's revenue, and not the long term trend.
 Low revenue years have a disproportionate impact on the long-term revenue
 capacity of the jurisdiction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second impact is related to the first.
 To the extent that COTELs bias revenue downward (in a manner quite uncoupled
 with demand projections), it becomes increasingly difficult for constrained
 jurisdictions to invest in the human and physical capital needed to support
 robust economic growth.
 The first effect impacts revenue generation, while the second impacts the
 capacity of the economic base itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A complicating factor is the existence of spillovers.
 Both the provision of public goods and the economic vitality of neighboring
 jurisdictions impact the fiscal and economic capacity of the primary jurisdicti
on.
 This externality network has the potential to dynamically reinforce economic
 growth behavior, whether it be a high or low growth regime.
 If COTELs exacerbate this effect, there could be undesirable long-term
 consequences for low capacity counties seeking to create the conditions
 for economic growth.
 Insofar as the relationship between COTEL intensity and spatial dependency
 is evaluated, this chapter explores this phenomenon directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
How is Fiscal Clustering Measured?

Testing whether or not the constraints imposed by COTELs lead to fiscal
 convergence is difficult to achieve with the prevailing models in this
 areas.
 Most of the empirical work attempts to study TELs across states, and as
 such, focuses on statewide definitions of TELs.
 This tends to cover up local variation, but perhaps more interestingly,
 this choice in geographic scope encourages certain kinds of questions.

Comparatively little research examines the within state dynamic.
 Once one asks the question about local differences, modeling the parameter
 of interest is a different game altogether.
 In this case, the researcher must tease out variation among fiscal circumstance
s for which statewide policy is a common denominator.
 Once this issue comes to the fore, one is immediately confronted with the
 following question: if the statewide policy does not vary cross-sectionally,
 do we expect uniform impact across all jurisdictions at time 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

? Fiscal behavior is a function of economic circumstance, and given the
 variation in economic bases across a given state, one would expect COTELs
 to have different impacts in different jurisdictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second, and related, question is whether or not we expect a temporal element
 in the impact of COTELs.
 Does the constraint placed on a county increase with the amount of time
 the county has spent operating under the COTEL? Furthermore, given the
 fact that the COTEL environment is composed of overlapping policies, do
 we expect interaction effects to play a role? To shed light on such questions,
 this study employs spatial techniques to examine a panel dataset of county-leve
l fiscal and economic data in Colorado over the 1987-2009 time period (econometr
ic exploration begins in 1995).
 First, we establish the existence of temporal variation in fiscal clustering,
 and then we employ econometric techniques to uncover the impact of COTEL
 intensity and the Gallagher Ratio.

Does Fiscal Clustering Occur and Does it Change Over Time?

The hypothesis rests on the idea that not only does spatial clustering of

 Without both of these conditions, there is no basis for measuring the impact

\begin_layout Plain Layout
From a spatial perspective, payroll is a superior measure of activity relative
 to income.
 Income is a person-based measure, and thus may be derived from neighboring
 jurisdictions if an individual commutes some distance to their place of
 employment.
 Payroll, by contrast, is a firm-based measure.
 Consequently, it is not capable of mobility in the same sense.
\end_layout

 the hotspots are identified with Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To evaluate clustering, LISAs require a definition of the linkages of importance
 between jurisdictions.
 Said differently, they require an explicitly defined local neighborhood.

 Corroboration across tests lends support to the findings.

 The most natural interpretation, the one employed in this study, is based
 upon spatial proximity.
 However, it is quite plausible to use other distance measures.
 For example, one might define neighbors as those counties with similar
 demographics, industrial bases, or any other characteristic of interest.
 Since the focus of this study is on siting choice given the cost of mobility,
 spatial proximity is a natural choice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking spatial proximity as the weight basis, there are a number of ways
 to define the neighborhood.
 This study employs two common approaches: contiguity and distance.
 As one might expect, contiguity requires contact to be considered a neighbor.
 Contact with the primary jurisdiction is not strictly required.
 A second order contiguous neighborhood, for example, would include neighbors
 that contacted a jurisdiction in contact with the primary jurisdiction.
 Distance, by contrast, includes as neighbors all jurisdictions within some
 distance of the primary jurisdictions.

Within the contiguity and distance classes of weight matrices, there are
 several variations on the theme.
 Figure

 shows two types of contiguous neighborhood definitions in the first two
 panels: rook and queen.
 As can be seen, these definitions are taken directly from the rules of
 chess.
 The third panel provides a generic view of a neighborhood defined via a
 distance metric.
 In this instance, distance is measured from the primary jurisdictions centroid,
 but one could envision distance from the closest border or the population's
 center of gravity being relevant metrics as well.

 Blue squares indicate weight values of 1, so those jurisdictions are

 Binary classification of neighbors is in no way a requirement.
 The strength of the weight may vary with proximity, and there are a number
 of decay functions in common use.
 This study employs three kinds: binary, inverse distance, and Gaussian.

 LMI reveals these dynamics by providing values for each spatial observation

 county), thereby enabling the analyst to take note of patterns (e.g.
 fiscal clusters).

Globally consistent trends in clustering are far from clear in the figures

 clustering as time passes.
 Extracting the marginal effect of COTEL intensity requires econometric
 exploration.
 In this analysis, we employ three approaches to explore this impact on
 measures of both revenue yield (per capita revenue;

Squares estimation serves as the baseline specification.
 It is primarily an exploratory modeling exercise to place the integration
 of spatial and temporal dependency in context.
 Two models, with per capita revenue and per capita annual payroll, the
 primary dependents, are evaluated.
 Furthermore, given the absence of an explicitly modeled spatial dependency
 structure, the pooled OLS approach facilitates the exploration of COTEL
 intensity impact on the LISAs defined above.
 The LISA subset of models use each combination of LISA measure, fiscal
 indicator, and weight matrix as the dependent variable.
 For example, one dependent (
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$w
\backslash

\backslash
_i$
\end_layout

\end_inset

) will be the LMI score for per capita revenue, as calculated with rook
 contiguity.
 Dependents capturing annual payroll include an extension:

 Subsection WMATRIX).
 Therefore, there are 20 LISA models.

 The decision to select one weight matrix for presentation is a function
 of two factors.
 First, the trends revealed by the analysis are generally insensitive to
 the choice of weight matrix.
 Second, presentation of all weight matrices is likely to suffer from diminishin
g returns while simultaneously inhibiting the central message.
 In general, this series of models provides some sense of temporal variation
 over time.
 There are two fiscal indicators (per capita revenue and per capita annual
 payroll) and 17 years (1993-2009 in five year increments), leading to a
 total of 34 models.

Panel estimation does not contain a spatial component, but it does enable
 us to incorporate county-level unobservable characteristics.
 This basically trades one specification element, spatial autoregression,
 for another, capture of county-specific factors that do not explicitly
 enter the model.
 The approach provides a cleaner view of TEL impacts than cross-sectional
 analysis because the fixed effects shift the focus to within county deviations.
 Two of these models are run, one for each dependent:

Econometrics as Observation

In total, there are 58 models that will be presented.
 One would be well within the bounds of reasonableness to ask why an analyst
 would even bother to attempt presentations of so many.
 The answer is that this inquiry seeks to partially address a certain type
 of estimating uncertainty.
 When estimating the parameters of an economic process, the precise nature
 of what we are estimating is somewhat unclear.

\begin_layout Standard
We may think of the autonomous relations as those which bind the components
 of the true, underlying data generating process.
 We know that, for example, the volume of a gas is proportional to its temperatu
re, which is just a measure of the kinetic energy in the gas.
 This is a natural linkage, in the sense that it is always true, everywhere.
 This is an autonomous relation.
 When we seek to measure such a phenomenon, however, one must worry about
 confluent relations.
 For example, we will not observe the natural linkage between temperature
 and volume if the volume is somehow constrained by another variable in
 the system.
 This would produce variation in our estimates, even if no such variation
 exists in the underlying data generating process.

Since we have no validation mechanism that reveals the data generating process
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If we did, of what value would estimation be?
\end_layout

, we cannot know if we are actually observing an autonomous or confluent
 relation.
 Consequently, Hoover suggests that we must assume all of our observations
 are confluent interactions between the more conceptually atomistic autonomous
 relations.
 The question remains, what is the appropriate mitigation strategy?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First and foremost, we must recognize that each econometric strategy we
 may employ has its failings.
 For example, fixed effect estimation is useful capturing group-specific
 characteristics, but by failing to identify the characteristics covered
 by the fixed effect explicitly it creates challenges in exploring the specific
 nature of their impacts.
 Just as a sample drawn from a population provides a specific view of the
 population that does not capture its full variety, the model an analyst
 chooses to employ captures a particular view of that sample.
 That view is a function of both the strengths and weaknesses of the modeling
 approach and the specification evaluated by the analyst.

Clearly, there are challenges associated with the presentation of 58 models.
 As mentioned above, however, our overarching concern is consistency.
 To what extent do the models tell the same story.
 With this in mind, we are afforded some flexibility in presentation.
 A graphical approach is taken here.
 Furthermore, a summary view of the LISA models is provided, each view of
 which shares averages of coefficient estimates, p-values, and model fit
 for all five weight matrices presented.
 In all of the visualizations that follow, three interpretations apply:

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pooled Ordinary Least Squares
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As will become apparent, the pooled OLS models provide a view of a counterintuit
ive, yet relatively consistent, narrative.
 While the COTEL intensity measure (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$intensity
\backslash
_stock$
\end_layout

\end_inset

) has the expected negative and statistically significant effect on revenue
 yield (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$pcrev$
\end_layout

\end_inset

), higher values of the intensity measure are consistently associated with
 higher levels of fiscal capacity (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$pcap$
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 This is a curious result that directly challenges the notion that COTELs
 limit the fiscal capacity of a given county.
 Furthermore, the same revenue yield relationship holds for the ratio of
 residential and non-residential property (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$prop
\backslash
ratio$
\end_layout

\end_inset

) used to capture the impact of the Gallagher Amendment (the Gallagher Ratio).
 Again, higher relative amounts of residential property are associated with
 lower revenue yields.
 This accords with intuition to the extent that GA is designed to limit
 residential property tax liability.
 Fiscal capacity, on the other hand, is higher in counties which have higher
 relative levels of residential property in the assessment base.

Note also the large disparity in model fit across the two models.
 This is a persistent character of this analysis - all of the revenue yield
 models explain a larger portion of the variance than do their fiscal capacity
 counterparts.
 This is perhaps unsurprising.
 The impact of institutions and economic changes on revenue yield is much
 more direct than is the impact on fiscal capacity.
 Complete identification of this indirect linkage can be pursued in future
 research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISAs)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the LISAs as dependents provides some notion of how the variables
 in the model impact spatial clustering of revenue yield and fiscal capacity.
 Counties experiencing higher levels of COTEL intensity are expected to
 converge in the revenue yield and fiscal capacity incomes.
 In effect, the COTELs are expected to retard their revenue growth, which
 will create a wedge between constrained and unconstrained counties.
 It has already been shown that spatial clustering of fiscal behavior occurs,
 so this wedge is expected to be spatiall relevant.
 The visualization of these results employs averages across the five weight
 matrices used in this analysis (see Subsecton 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Weight-Matrices"

\end_inset

).
 Again, this is to limit the sensitivity of interpretation to choice of
 the local neighborhood, 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$W$
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reiterate, high values of LMI indicate the clustering of similar values,
 while low values indicate the clustering of disimilar values.
 In other words, high values of LMI can indicate the presence of a local
 neighborhood of counties characterized by either high revenue yield/fiscal
 capacity or low revenue yield/fiscal capacity.
 In contrast, high values of GOG indicate clustering of high values, while
 low values of GOG indicate clustering of low values.
 Thus, LMI reveals more about the strength of clustering while GOG reveals
 more about the type of clustering.

When controlling for other factors, COTEL intensity (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$intensity
\backslash
_stock$

) has very limited impact on the clustering of revenue yield (
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

).

 not a significant driver of the clustering that already exists.
