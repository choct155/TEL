      "Given the capacity of counties in Colorado to exempt themselves from the restrictions of [TABOR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxpayer_Bill_of_Rights) and the Statewide Limit on Property Tax Revenue (SLPTR), it is important to address the question of whether or not these tax and expenditure limitations obstruct the convergence of voter preferences and public policy outcomes.  Here are brief descriptions of these policies from [House Joint Resolution 03-1033 Study: TABOR, Amendment 23, the Gallagher Amendment and Other Fiscal Issues](http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheader=application%2Fpdf&blobkey=id&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobwhere=1239165968612&ssbinary=true):\n",
